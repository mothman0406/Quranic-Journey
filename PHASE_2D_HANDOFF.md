# NoorPath / Quranic Journey — Phase 2D Slice 5b Handoff

**For: the next Codex/Claude Code conversation continuing this project**
**Last updated: 2026-04-28 (Slice 5a Session 3 cumulative review implemented locally; hardware QA + branch sync next, then Slice 5b real blur)**

This handoff supersedes earlier handoff drafts.

## 1. The user (Mohammad)

You're working with a self-taught builder doing this project on weekends and evenings. Father of multiple kids he wants to teach Quran memorization to. Sharp product instincts, fast on the keyboard, treats Claude as a peer not a teacher.

- He hates UI work. Wants things to "be there by default."
- He prefers Claude Code (the agentic CLI) make all code changes. The pattern that works: I draft a precise prompt as a markdown block; he pastes it into a fresh Claude Code session at the repo root; Claude Code reports SHA + typecheck; we iterate. Direct filesystem edits from the chat assistant are reserved for tiny things (config files, doc updates).
- One terminal command at a time, not walls.
- "Let's keep going" / "next" / "good" means it. Don't suggest stopping.
- He pushes back hard when scope is wrong. Take it seriously, but don't preemptively scope down — ship the right slice and offer the slicing plan transparently.
- Test-then-ship. Every slice gets tested on hardware (EAS dev build) before the next prompt is drafted. Don't skip ahead.
- He's fine being told something is hard. Don't sandbag.
- **Critical convention: only ever LOOSEN matching/acceptance, never tighten without asking.** The recite mode matcher is at parity with the web app and works well in real testing. Don't make it stricter.
- He's pragmatic about partial wins. When tajweed didn't render in Session 2, his response was "let's add that to the queue as well: not one of the more important features." Don't try to over-investigate broken things if they're not blocking — note them and move on.

## 2. The project

**NoorPath** is a Quran memorization/review/reading app for kids 3–18. Originally a web app at `artifacts/noor-path/` (frozen archival); now an iOS app at `artifacts/noor-mobile/` being shipped slice by slice.

### Repo
- GitHub: `https://github.com/mothman0406/Quranic-Journey`
- Local: `/Users/mothmanaurascape.ai/Desktop/Quranic-Journey/`
- Normal branch policy: `main` (deploy) and `feature/main-working-branch` stay synced. **Current exception:** corrected Slice 5a Session 3 work is local on `safe-cumulative` through `b2b3186`. `origin/main` still points at obsolete `d01fae2` (wrong Mark Complete-style cumulative review) and `origin/feature/main-working-branch` is still `6104bce`. Before 5b, hardware-test the local branch and then sync/push the corrected work to both branches.

### Stack
- **Monorepo:** pnpm 9.15.9 (NOT 10).
- **Backend:** Express 5 + Drizzle + Neon Postgres + Better Auth, deployed at `https://workspaceapi-server-production-cc25.up.railway.app`. Live, healthy.
- **Web frontend** (`artifacts/noor-path/`): React 19 + Vite + shadcn/ui. **Frozen archival reference.** Don't edit.
- **iOS app** (`artifacts/noor-mobile/`): Expo SDK 54.0.33, Expo Router 6, RN 0.81.5. **The active build target.**
- **Apple Developer:** approved Apr 26. Team ID `M7KJJDN537`. iOS bundle identifier `com.mothman.noorpath`.
- **EAS project:** `@mothman123/noor-mobile`. First development build shipped Apr 27 evening; installed on Mohammad's registered iPhone with Developer Mode enabled.

## 3. Where the project is right now

**Phase 2D Slices 1–4 + Slice 5a Sessions 1+2 are shipped, hardware-tested, working very well. Slice 5a Session 3 is implemented locally on `safe-cumulative` and typechecked, but still needs hardware QA and branch sync.** Recite mode at parity with web. Multi-reciter playback works for all 7 reciters. Word tracking works for all (true QDC for Husary, fractional fallback w/ 500ms lead for others). Audio plays through iPhone silent switch. Theme + reciter pickers in settings sheet. Profile vs session settings split. **Long-press translation popup works.** **Playback rate (0.75x–1.5x discrete pills) works.** **Cumulative review is implemented locally.** **Tajweed coloring wired but doesn't render** (likely API field shape — backlogged; do not tackle before 5b unless Mohammad explicitly asks).

| Slice | Status | Commit | What |

| 2D-Polish 5a Session 2 | ✅ tested (tajweed broken — backlogged) | `18f054d` | Translation popup, playback rate, tajweed wiring (no colors) |
| 2D-Polish 5a Session 3 | 🟡 local, typechecked; hardware QA next | `4599dff` + fixes through `b2b3186` on `safe-cumulative` | Web-style cumulative review during memorization, review repeat count, pass labels, final-verse skip fixes |
| **2D-Polish 5b** | 🔜 **next after Session 3 QA/sync** | — | Real `expo-blur` (requires EAS rebuild). Tajweed explicitly deferred. |

`TODO.md` is current. Read it first.

## 4. The single most important file

`artifacts/noor-mobile/app/child/[childId]/memorization.tsx` — **the entire memorization product, ~1500 lines after Slice 5a Session 3**. Plus supporting libs: `src/lib/memorization.ts`, `src/lib/quran.ts`, `src/lib/recite.ts`, `src/lib/mushaf-theme.ts`, `src/lib/reciters.ts`, `src/lib/settings.ts`, `src/lib/audio.ts`, `src/lib/tajweed.ts`.

Don't refactor preemptively. If it gets unwieldy after 5b, extract `lib/memorization-audio.ts` and `lib/memorization-recite.ts`.

### Architectural notes (current state, post-Slice-5a-Session-3 local)

**Two render modes** controlled by `viewMode: "ayah" | "page"`. Toggle pills under the header.

**Audio state lives in refs.** `expo-av`'s status callback closes over stale state. Pattern:
```ts
const [foo, setFoo] = useState(...);
const fooRef = useRef(foo);
useEffect(() => { fooRef.current = foo; }, [foo]);
```

Important refs as of Slice 5a Session 3: `viewModeRef`, `currentVerseRef`, `playingVerseNumberRef`, `ayahStartRef`, `ayahEndRef`, `isPlayingRef`, `isLoadingRef`, `pendingSeekPositionRef`, `repeatCountRef`, `autoAdvanceDelayRef`, `autoplayThroughRangeRef`, `internalPhaseRef`, `cumAyahIdxRef`, `cumPassRef`, `cumUpToRef`, `cumulativeReviewRef`, `reviewRepeatCountRef`, `reciteModeRef`, `reciteExpectedIdxRef`, `displayWordsMapRef`, `surahNumberRef`, `matchedWordCountRef`, `lastMatchedWordRef`, `lastMatchTimeRef`, `reciterRef`, `saveTimerRef`, `playbackRateRef`. Plus timer/raf/sound refs.

**`handlePlayPause` reads ONLY refs.** Critical. After Slice 4 hotfix v2 the function gates exclusively on `isPlayingRef.current` and `isLoadingRef.current` to close the load-completion race window.

**`stopAudioCompletely()`** is the single audio cleanup point.

**Two highlight states.** `highlightedWord: number` (0-based, ayah mode) and `highlightedPage: { verseKey, position } | null` (1-based to match `ApiWord.position`, page mode). Both updated from the same RAF tick.

**Verse-change effect (`[currentVerse]`)** behaves differently for recite vs Husary mode. In recite mode it sets highlight to word 0. In Husary mode it clears to -1.

**Multi-reciter timing routing (Slice 5a Session 1):**
- `fetchTimingsForReciter(reciter, surah)` returns a `ChapterTimings` discriminated union
- Husary: `{ kind: "chapter", map: ... }` — synchronous lookup
- Others: `{ kind: "ondemand", fetch: (verse) => ... }` — per-verse v4 fetch (cached)
- v4 returns no segments for non-Husary → `tick()` falls back to fractional formula

**Fractional fallback (Slice 5a Session 1 final):**
```ts
const LEAD_MS = 500;
const shiftedPos = pos + LEAD_MS;
const shiftedFrac = Math.min(shiftedPos / dur, 1);
found = Math.min(Math.floor(shiftedFrac * wordCount), wordCount - 1);
```
Provides anticipatory feel. Works for short ayahs; trails on long ones — accepted limitation.

**iOS audio session:** `Audio.setAudioModeAsync({ playsInSilentModeIOS: true })` mandatory. `setVolumeAsync(1.0)` on every Sound. `expo-av` and `expo-speech-recognition` can't both hold the session — `pauseAsync()` not enough, must `unloadAsync()`.

**Profile vs session settings (Slice 5a Session 1):**
- Profile-level (persist): `themeKey`, `reciterId`, `viewMode`. Persistence currently buggy.
- Session-level (`DEFAULT_SESSION_SETTINGS`): `repeatCount`, `autoAdvanceDelayMs`, `autoplayThroughRange`, `blurMode`, `blindMode`.
- Session 2 added `playbackRate` (default 1.0) and `tajweedEnabled` (default false) as plain inline `useState`, NOT in `DEFAULT_SESSION_SETTINGS`.

**Translation popup (Slice 5a Session 2):**
- `word_fields=translation` + `translations=131` (Sahih International) on both fetchers
- `translation` field on word may be `{ text, language_name }` or plain string — `getTranslationText` handles both
- `onLongPress` with `delayLongPress={400}`. Short tap still triggers tap-to-seek.
- Modal pattern: outer `Pressable` backdrop with `onPress={close}`, inner card is also `Pressable` with empty `onPress={() => {}}` to absorb taps. Plain `View` would let taps bubble.

**Playback rate (Slice 5a Session 2):**
- `PLAYBACK_RATES = [0.75, 0.85, 1.0, 1.15, 1.25, 1.5]` discrete pill scroller
- Skipped `@react-native-community/slider` (has native code, would require rebuild)
- `setRateAsync(rate, true)` in `playVerse` after `createAsync`
- Separate effect pushes mid-playback rate changes to active sound

**Cumulative review (Slice 5a Session 3 local):**
- Web-style state machine, not a Mark Complete after-pass.
- `internalPhase: "single" | "cumulative"` drives whether the audio is playing the study verse or cumulative review.
- `currentVerse` remains the single-phase study cursor. `playingVerseNumber` is what actually plays/highlights; in cumulative phase it is `ayahStart + cumAyahIdx`.
- `cumulativeReview` toggle defaults false. `reviewRepeatCount` defaults 3 and ranges 1-10.
- After a new verse finishes normal repeats, if cumulative review is enabled and `currentVerse > ayahStart`, cumulative plays `ayahStart..currentVerse` for `reviewRepeatCount` passes.
- During cumulative, each verse plays once regardless of normal repeat count.
- Header labels:
  - single phase with repeat count > 1: `Pass X/Y · Verse A of B`
  - cumulative phase: `Pass X/Y · Ayahs A-B`
- `Next` during single phase enters cumulative if cumulative review is due, including on the final verse. `Next` during cumulative exits cumulative and advances/completes. `Prev` during cumulative bails back to single phase.
- Latest local commit for repeat-pass header: `b2b3186`.

**Tajweed (Slice 5a Session 2 — wired but not rendering):**
- `src/lib/tajweed.ts` has 21-class `TAJWEED_COLORS` map + `extractTajweedColor(html)` helper
- `text_uthmani_tajweed` added as `word_field` on both fetchers (likely the bug — see backlog in TODO.md)
- Toggle wired into settings sheet
- Both renderers call `extractTajweedColor(word.text_uthmani_tajweed)` for in-scope words
- **Doesn't color anything.** Probably need verse-level `text_uthmani_tajweed` + `splitTajweedIntoWords` parser like the web. Backlogged.

### The recite matcher (`src/lib/recite.ts`)

Parity with the web app. Don't tighten without asking. Carry-over from Slice 4 + hotfixes.

### The fixed controls island

Below the ScrollView. Three rows: Mode buttons (Blind, Recite), audio controls (Prev, Play, Next), Mark Complete (full width black).

### The settings sheet (current ordering)

Bottom modal, opened by gear icon top-right of header.

1. Repeat count stepper (1–10)
2. Auto-advance delay stepper (0–5s, 0.5s steps)
3. Autoplay-through-range toggle
4. Blur-other-verses toggle
5. Tajweed coloring toggle (wired but not rendering)
6. Cumulative review toggle
7. Review repeat count stepper (conditional; visible when cumulative review is on)
8. Playback speed pills (0.75x, 0.85x, 1x, 1.15x, 1.25x, 1.5x)
9. Theme pills (8 themes)
10. Reciter pills (7 reciters, last-name only)
11. Done button

## 5. Slice 5a Session 3 — current QA/sync checklist

Cumulative review is implemented locally on branch `safe-cumulative` through `b2b3186`. It is JS-only and `cd artifacts/noor-mobile && npx tsc --noEmit` was clean after the latest repeat-pass header change.

Do **not** use `origin/main` as canonical for Session 3 yet: it still has `d01fae2`, the earlier wrong "after Mark Complete" approach. The canonical corrected local chain is:

- `4599dff` — real web-style cumulative review state machine
- `2eaad4b` — single-phase Next enters cumulative instead of skipping review
- `34d0172` — final-verse Next starts final cumulative review
- `2147b07` — final-verse Next button enabled for cumulative review
- `b2b3186` — normal repeated verses show `Pass X/Y · Verse A of B`

Hardware QA before 5b:
- Al-Nasr 1-4, `repeatCount=3`, `reviewRepeatCount=2`, cumulative on. Expected: verse 1 repeats 3x; verse 2 repeats 3x; cumulative 1-2 twice; verse 3 repeats 3x; cumulative 1-3 twice; verse 4 repeats 3x; cumulative 1-4 twice; then complete.
- On final verse, Next/skip must be enabled and start final cumulative review.
- Next during final cumulative should exit cumulative and complete the session.
- Prev during cumulative should bail to single phase and stay on the current study verse.
- Pause/resume during cumulative should resume the current cumulative verse.
- Single-verse range should never enter cumulative.
- `cumulativeReview=false` should preserve previous behavior.
- Header labels should show normal repeat pass (`Pass X/Y · Verse A of B`) and cumulative pass (`Pass X/Y · Ayahs A-B`).

After QA, sync branches:
```
git push origin safe-cumulative:main
git checkout feature/main-working-branch
git merge main
git push origin feature/main-working-branch
git checkout main
```

If push policy blocks direct remote updates, ask Mohammad to explicitly approve pushing the local `safe-cumulative` work to both branches.

---

## 6. Slice 5b — next action items

Goal: real blur via `expo-blur`. This replaces the opacity-0.35 fallback currently used by `blurMode` in `memorization.tsx`.

Scope:
- Do **not** fix tajweed in 5b. Mohammad said "No tajweed for now" on Apr 28.
- Native dependency is allowed here because 5b already requires an EAS rebuild.
- Keep the code change focused on `artifacts/noor-mobile/app/child/[childId]/memorization.tsx`, except package manifest/lockfile changes from installing `expo-blur`.
- Do not add `expo-linear-gradient` unless real blur cannot be made presentable without it.

Implementation checklist:
1. Start from a clean, QA-approved Session 3 branch.
2. Install `expo-blur` in the mobile workspace. Watch for the Expo/pnpm trap: if `npx expo install` creates `artifacts/noor-mobile/package-lock.json`, delete it and keep the root `pnpm-lock.yaml` as the only lockfile.
3. Import `BlurView` from `expo-blur`.
4. Replace the page-mode opacity fallback (`styles.mushafWordBlurred`) with real blur for inactive in-scope words/verses while audio is playing.
5. Preserve current semantics:
   - active verse remains readable/unblurred
   - out-of-scope words remain dimmed
   - blind mode still hides/reveals as before
   - tap-to-seek and long-press translation still work
   - cumulative review and normal playback both update the active verse correctly via `playingVerseNumber`
6. Avoid layout shifts. If per-word `BlurView` wrappers cause text wrapping or press handling problems, prefer a stable per-verse/line overlay approach in page mode.
7. Run `cd artifacts/noor-mobile && npx tsc --noEmit`.
8. Run dev client: `cd artifacts/noor-mobile && npx expo start --dev-client`.
9. Build the new iOS dev client: `cd artifacts/noor-mobile && npx eas-cli@latest build --profile development --platform ios`.
10. Install on iPhone and hardware-test:
    - blur mode on/off while page-mode audio plays
    - active verse unblurs as playback advances
    - cumulative review still works
    - playback rate still applies
    - all 7 reciters still play
    - long-press translation still opens
    - blind mode still reveals/toggles
    - recite mode still unloads audio and starts mic cleanly
11. Commit and sync both branches.

After 5b ships, Phase 2D is complete.

---

## 7. After Phase 2D

Per user (confirmed Apr 27 evening): Option A — finish Slice 5 first, then do 2E + 2F before TestFlight.

- **Phase 2E** — Dashboard polish (today's-work content on Mem/Review/Reading banners, red/orange/green surah quality colors, profile selector polish)
- **Phase 2F** — Target-setting UI (set memorization/review/reading targets by page number — backend already supports it via dashboard endpoint)
- **Then Phase 3** — TestFlight (app icon, splash, EAS production build, App Store Connect, TestFlight beta)

User also requested **deep-dive into web app's `noor-path/` for "lots of cool stuff that took a lot of work"** — to be done after Phase 2 completes. Consider during Phase 2E/2F drafting.

---

## 8. The conventions

### Workflow

- Claude Code prompts as markdown blocks. User pastes; reports back commit SHA + typecheck.
- **Test-then-ship.** Every slice tested on EAS dev build before next prompt drafted.
- **Docs after every meaningful action.** Update `TODO.md` and `PHASE_2D_HANDOFF.md` with current date, active branch, latest local SHA, remote sync status, QA results, and the exact next checklist. Never leave a completed slice described as "next."
- Read existing files before writing. Don't guess data shapes.
- Both branches stay in sync. Every commit:
  ```
  git push origin main
  git checkout feature/main-working-branch
  git merge main
  git push origin feature/main-working-branch
  git checkout main
  ```
- **Heredoc trap:** never use bare `EOF` markers. Use `MEMO_EOF`, `LIB_EOF`, `THEME_EOF`, etc.

### Code style for noor-mobile

- Expo Router 6 file-based routing
- TypeScript strict
- StyleSheet API
- Color palette in non-Mushaf-mode UI: bg `#ffffff`, text `#111111`, secondary `#666666`, border `#e5e7eb`, primary `#2563eb`, danger `#dc2626`, card-bg `#f9fafb`. Mushaf 8-theme palette in `src/lib/mushaf-theme.ts`.
- Card style: `borderRadius: 12`, padding `16`, `backgroundColor: "#f9fafb"`, `borderWidth: 1`, `borderColor: "#e5e7eb"`
- Header: `paddingTop: 60`, back button left, centered title, button or spacer right (60 wide)
- No state libraries. Plain `useState` + `useEffect` + `useRef`.
- No UI libraries. Plain RN components.
- API calls go through `apiFetch<T>` from `src/lib/api.ts` for the Railway backend.
- External APIs (Quran.com, QDC, GitHub raw, everyayah) use native `fetch` directly, no auth.

### Existing src/lib files

- `src/lib/api.ts` — `apiFetch<T>` typed helper, Better Auth cookie attached
- `src/lib/auth-client.ts` — Better Auth Expo client
- `src/lib/audio.ts` — `ayahAudioUrl(reciter, surah, ayah)`
- `src/lib/mushaf.ts` — page-image URL helper for Reading mode
- `src/lib/mushaf-theme.ts` — 8-theme `THEMES` map, `ThemeKey`, `MushafTheme`, etc.
- `src/lib/quran.ts` — Quran.com v4 fetchers with `text_uthmani_tajweed` + `translation` word_fields + `translations=131`
- `src/lib/memorization.ts` — dashboard fetch, QDC chapter timings, on-demand v4 fetcher, `fetchTimingsForReciter` router, `ChapterTimings` discriminated union, memorization POST
- `src/lib/recite.ts` — Arabic normalization + multi-predicate fuzzy match. **Don't tighten without asking.**
- `src/lib/reviews.ts` — typed review queue + submit
- `src/lib/reciters.ts` — 7-reciter table
- `src/lib/settings.ts` — `ProfileSettings`, `loadProfileSettings`, `saveProfileSettings`, `DEFAULT_SESSION_SETTINGS`
- `src/lib/tajweed.ts` — `TAJWEED_COLORS` map + `extractTajweedColor` helper (wiring shipped Session 2; coloring not rendering — see backlog)

### Known pitfalls

- **Metro + pnpm**: `metro.config.js` must set `watchFolders` and `nodeModulesPaths`. After native dep changes, `npx expo start --clear`.
- **`npx expo install` in pnpm monorepo** can create stray `package-lock.json` in `noor-mobile/`. Delete it and run `pnpm install` from repo root.
- **Cookie auth**: RN has no `document.cookie`. Existing `apiFetch` handles it.
- **Audio leaks**: always `unloadAsync()` `Audio.Sound` instances. Use `stopAudioCompletely()`.
- **iOS audio session**: `pauseAsync()` not enough to release for the mic. Must `unloadAsync()`.
- **iOS silent switch**: `Audio.setAudioModeAsync({ playsInSilentModeIOS: true })` mandatory.
- **everyayah folder names**: stale ones break audio with `AVPlayerItem -1100`. Verify against `https://www.everyayah.com/recitations_pages.html`.
- **Quran.com v4 `by_ayah` segments**: returns `undefined` for non-Husary reciter IDs.
- **Quran.com v4 `text_uthmani_tajweed`**: likely only available at verse level, NOT word level (Session 2 tajweed broken because of this assumption).
- **EAS dev build for native deps**: required for `expo-blur`, `@react-native-community/slider`, etc. Pure JS hot-reloads.

### EAS Build basics

- CLI: `npx eas-cli@latest <cmd>`
- Build: `eas build --profile development --platform ios`
- After build, install via QR code on the build's "Install" page; trust developer profile in iPhone Settings → General → VPN & Device Management.
- iOS 16+ requires Developer Mode (toggle only appears AFTER an internal-distribution app installed once).
- Run dev server: `npx expo start --dev-client`.

## 9. What to do first in the next session

1. **Read `TODO.md` and this handoff.** This one supersedes earlier handoffs.
2. **Check git state.** Expected local branch is `safe-cumulative` at or after `b2b3186`. Remote branches may still be stale.
3. **Do not start 5b until Slice 5a Session 3 is hardware-tested.** Run the cumulative review QA checklist in Section 5.
4. **After QA, sync the corrected local work to `main` and `feature/main-working-branch`.** If the push needs explicit approval, ask Mohammad.
5. **Then implement Slice 5b (`expo-blur`) using Section 6.** Do not touch tajweed unless Mohammad explicitly changes his mind.
6. **Same Codex/Claude Code prompt pattern as throughout this project.**

---

## 10. The one important reminder

The whole reason this app exists is so Mohammad's kids can use it to memorize Quran with him. The app already works for that purpose — kid sits down with iPhone, opens NoorPath, picks themself, hits Memorization, sees today's verses, hits Play, follows their chosen reciter (Husary, Afasy, Sudais, Basit, Minshawi, Ghamdi, or Ajmi) word by word in the Madinah-themed Mushaf at their preferred speed (0.75x for slow learning, 1x for normal, faster for review), long-presses any word for an English translation, marks complete, and it lands in Review. They can recite back to the app and get word-by-word feedback. They can switch themes. That's done.

Slice 5a Session 3 added cumulative review (the retention secret weapon) locally and needs final hardware QA/sync. 5b adds real blur. After that Phase 2D is done and we move to dashboard polish (2E) + target setting (2F) before TestFlight.

Phase 3 takes it through TestFlight to the App Store.

Good luck.
