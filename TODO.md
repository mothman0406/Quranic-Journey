# NoorPath / Quranic Journey — Status & Next Steps

_Last updated: April 29, 2026 (Phase 2G.1 diagnostic cleanup implemented locally; hardware QA pending; Phase 3/TestFlight deferred until Phase 2H must-have parity is triaged/completed)_

---

## Documentation rule for every new action

After every meaningful action, update this file and `PHASE_2D_HANDOFF.md` before handing off:

- Update the "Last updated" line with the date and actual current state.
- Record the active branch, latest local SHA, and whether remote branches are synced or stale.
- Move completed work out of "next" sections and into the done/current-state section.
- Add any hardware QA results or known failures immediately.
- Make the next action checklist concrete enough that a fresh Codex/Claude chat can start without reconstructing context.

## Current work log — April 29, 2026

- Active branch/SHA at Phase 2G.1 start: `main` at `c57773f`. Phase 2G.1 cleanup commit: current `main` HEAD containing this docs update.
- Remote sync status at Phase 2G.1 start: `main`, `origin/main`, `feature/main-working-branch`, and `origin/feature/main-working-branch` were synced at `c57773f`. After this Phase 2G.1 commit is pushed, both tracked branches must be synced to the current Phase 2G.1 HEAD. `safe-cumulative` was temporary archaeology and can be ignored.
- QA status: Phase 2D memorization core through Slice 5b, Phase 2E dashboard polish, and Phase 2F target-setting UI were hardware-tested. Phase 2G.1 local validation passed with `cd artifacts/noor-mobile && npx tsc --noEmit` and `git diff --check`; no Expo server or hardware QA was run in this pass.
- Dev-server note: starting Expo inside the sandbox fails with `ERR_SOCKET_BAD_PORT` because sandboxed Node cannot bind local ports (`EPERM` on 8081). Run the dev server outside the sandbox/escalated when using this environment.
- TestFlight status: **Phase 3/TestFlight is deferred** until the web-app parity audit's must-have mobile items are triaged and the Phase 2H pre-TestFlight items are completed or explicitly moved to post-beta.
- Inspection notes: initial Phase 2E inspection found `app/child/[childId]/index.tsx` was a three-card skeleton; `src/lib/api.ts` is a thin authenticated fetch helper; `/api/children/:id/dashboard` exposes `todaysPlan.newMemorization`, `todayProgress`, `reviewsDueToday`, and `readingGoal`; `/api/children/:id/reviews` exposes detailed queue items with `reviewPriority`.
- Implementation notes: mobile dashboard now fetches dashboard plus review queue data, the Memorization/Review/Reading cards show today's assigned work, review previews use shared red/orange/green priority styling, the review queue cards have matching priority rails/backgrounds, and the profile selector has richer child rows with age, streak, and points.
- Diff-review notes: removed new dashboard letter spacing and fixed streak pluralization before final QA.
- Phase 2F inspection notes: targets are stored on `children` as `memorizePagePerDay`, `reviewPagesPerDay`, and `readPagesPerDay`; `GET /api/children/:childId` returns them through `formatChild`; `PUT /api/children/:childId` accepts all three fields. Web reference options live in `artifacts/noor-path/src/pages/settings.tsx`.
- Phase 2F implementation notes: added `app/child/[childId]/targets.tsx`, registered it in the child stack, added a dashboard `Targets` entry point, and made the dashboard refresh on focus after returning from target edits. The screen uses preset chips plus minus/plus fine tuning and saves directly through `apiFetch`.
- Phase 2F hotfix notes: after screenshots showed the dashboard rendering API 500s for L and Joll, production was checked directly and returned 200 for both children. `apiFetch` now sends `x-local-date` from the phone and normalizes JSON/plain-text/HTML failures into short readable error messages instead of showing full HTML documents. The dashboard now retries `/dashboard` once and then falls back to child/profile plus review queue data, keeping Targets reachable if today's plan endpoint flakes. Fresh inspection found that if the fallback path itself fails, the full-screen error still only shows the original dashboard error, so the phone cannot distinguish stale JS, wrong API base, dashboard failure, review failure, or child fallback failure yet.
- Phase 2F diagnostic implementation notes: added `ApiError`, `getApiRuntimeInfo`, console request/response logs, and diagnostic marker `dashboard-diag-2026-04-28a` in mobile `apiFetch`. The dashboard now tracks primary/retry/fallback review/fallback child stages, renders a compact diagnostic panel on fallback/error, and if the child fallback fetch fails it renders a degraded shell from route params instead of the original full-screen dashboard 500.
- Phase 2F route bug diagnosis: dashboard `handleTargetsPress` used relative `pathname: "./targets"`, which Expo Router resolved as `/child/targets` instead of `/child/:childId/targets`. That made the dashboard route match `[childId] = "targets"` on return/reload, causing API calls to `/api/children/targets/*`.
- Phase 2F route fix notes: dashboard Targets navigation now uses absolute `pathname: "/child/[childId]/targets"`, and dashboard loading now rejects non-numeric child IDs before making API calls.
- Phase 2F hardware QA notes: Mohammad reported the QA check passed after the route fix. The child dashboard no longer gets stuck on `/api/children/targets/*`, and the Targets/dashboard flow is unblocked.
- Phase 2G.1 implementation notes: removed the temporary visible dashboard diagnostic panel, deleted the `[noor-api]` request/response/error console logs, and removed the temporary dashboard diagnostic marker/runtime helper. Preserved `ApiError`, readable API errors, `x-local-date`, Better Auth cookie handling, dashboard retry/fallback behavior, degraded fallback shell, and numeric route-param validation.
- Exact next checklist:
  1. Finish syncing this Phase 2G.1 commit to `main`, `origin/main`, `feature/main-working-branch`, and `origin/feature/main-working-branch`.
  2. Mohammad hardware spot-check: dashboard normal load/refresh, Targets route stays `/child/:childId/targets`, and dashboard fallback still keeps cards/Targets usable if `/dashboard` flakes.
  3. If hardware QA passes, mark Phase 2G.1 hardware-tested.
  4. Implement Phase 2G.2 mobile IA shell/More screen before adding new feature pages.
  5. Triage Phase 2H with Mohammad: either complete all 2H pre-TestFlight slices or explicitly mark any slice as post-beta before Phase 3 resumes.
  6. Keep tajweed as documented backlog only; do not tighten recite matching; do not edit web app or generated files manually; keep future implementation JS-only unless a native rebuild is explicitly approved.

### Web-app parity audit summary

Mobile already has:
- Better Auth sign-in, persisted session, existing-child profile picker, sign-out.
- Child dashboard with today's memorization/review/reading cards, review previews, streak/points, pull-to-refresh, target entry point, and fallback behavior that keeps the dashboard usable if today's plan flakes.
- Targets screen for `memorizePagePerDay`, `reviewPagesPerDay`, and `readPagesPerDay`.
- Memorization core with today's assignment fetch, ayah/page modes, word-level audio highlight, repeat controls, auto-advance delay, cumulative review, reciter selection, 8 themes, playback speed, blind mode, blur mode, translation popup, recite mode, and mark-complete persistence.
- Review queue with red/orange/green priority cards, reviewed-today section, and a page-image review session with Husary audio and 0-5 SM-2 rating submission.
- Full Quran reading shell with streamed 604 page images, RTL paging, last-page resume from `readingGoal`, manual Save Page, debounced auto-save, and fixed jump buttons.

Web has that mobile still lacks:
- Mobile child creation/onboarding, pre-memorized surah setup, per-surah initial strength/known ayah counts, profile edit/delete, profile content toggles, and richer parent controls.
- A persistent child navigation shell or More screen exposing Progress, Learning Plan, Stories, Du'aas, Settings, and Full Quran. Mobile currently has stack-only routes for dashboard, memorization, review, review-session, Mushaf, and targets.
- Dashboard parity: story/dua cards, goals teaser, achievements preview, memorization stats, weekly activity, next-surah preview, richer quick actions, and web-like empty/completed states.
- Memorization overview/list page: current work/next up, surah search/jump, filters, ayah strength visualization, expanded ayah circles, Mark All Done, surah detail study cards, setup/chooser flow, resume bookmark, teacher/app recitation completion flow, and quality-rating-based completion. Mobile has the session engine but not the discovery/planning surface.
- Review richness: upcoming queue, completed-day/ahead-day local session behavior, flashcard mode, connected Mushaf batch review, sticky controls, reciter/speed settings inside review, richer fallback states, and web-like review celebration.
- Full Quran reader richness: search by surah/page/juz, recent reads, bookmarks, highlights, notes, translation/tafsir/word-by-word sheets, audio range player, select-to-mark-memorized, recite-from-page, and better page navigation.
- Progress/achievements: dedicated progress page, charts/bars, earned and in-progress badges, weekly/monthly/session history, memorized surah list, review strength visualization, and daily progress bars.
- Stories and du'aas: no mobile story list/detail, dua list/detail/status, category filters, learned/practice tracking UI, morals, or discussion questions.
- Plans/lessons: no mobile age-group learning plan page, milestone page, goals page, lesson flow, or surah-detail learning page. Tajweed notes are present on web but remain a backlog-only item for mobile.
- Visual system: web feels richer through patterned headers, compact stats, color-coded cards, badges, horizontal filters, achievement progress bars, and a clear bottom nav. Mobile is functional but thin and mostly white/gray cards.

Highest-risk missing items before TestFlight:
- Phase 2G.1 removed the temporary visible dashboard diagnostic panel and noisy API logs; hardware fallback QA is still pending.
- New beta users cannot create or configure a child profile in the mobile app.
- The app does not expose major product surfaces through mobile navigation, so it feels incomplete even where backend data exists.
- Stories, du'aas, progress, achievements, plan, and settings/profile controls are absent from mobile.
- The reading screen is too bare for real use beyond sequential paging.
- `POST /api/children/:childId/duas` appears to update the first child dua row for a child instead of filtering by `duaId`; fix before implementing mobile dua status.
- OpenAPI/client contracts lag current backend response shapes in places such as `reviewedToday`, dashboard reading progress, and newer daily-progress fields. Edit `lib/api-spec/openapi.yaml` and regenerate, never manual generated-file edits.

### Area-by-area parity notes

1. Dashboard/child home: mobile has three work cards plus streak/points; web adds goals, achievements, stats, today story/dua, next surah, richer quick actions, and bottom nav.
2. Memorization: mobile has the core learner; web adds the chooser/overview, filters/search, ayah strength map, explicit teacher/app test flow, resume/setup, and richer completion. Do not touch recite matcher behavior. Do not pursue tajweed beyond documenting it as backlogged.
3. Review: mobile has queue/session/SM-2 rating; web adds local-day session grouping, upcoming/completed sections, flashcards, batch Mushaf review, reciter/speed/blur controls, and better fallback/celebration states.
4. Reading/full Quran: mobile has image paging and progress save; web adds search/jump, resume/recent reads, bookmarks, highlights, notes, translation/tafsir/word tools, audio range playback, memorization handoff, and recite/select modes.
5. Settings/targets/parent controls: mobile has target pages only; web has practice minutes, content visibility, child profile settings, daily goal presets, profile creation/deletion, and default practice settings.
6. Progress/streaks/goals/achievements: mobile surfaces streak/points only; web has a full progress page, chart, badges, session history, goals, memorized counts, and dashboard widgets.
7. Stories/du'aas: mobile has no routes; web has category filters, detail pages, learned status, practice counts, morals, and discussion questions.
8. Plans/lessons: mobile lacks plan/lesson/surah-detail flows; web has age-group plan, milestones, weekly goals, goals reset, and surah detail content.
9. Navigation/IA: mobile needs a child-level nav shell or More screen. Suggested first pass: Dashboard, Memorization, Review, More, with More exposing Reading, Progress, Plan, Stories, Du'aas, Settings/Targets.
10. Visual/layout parity: port the web's working-app richness, not a landing page. Favor dense but warm parent-usable cards, compact stats, kid-friendly color, clear sections, and no marketing hero layout.

### Prioritized mobile roadmap

#### Phase 2G — Diagnostic cleanup + web parity foundation

Pre-TestFlight: yes.

| Slice | Goal | Likely files | Backend/API deps | Risk | QA |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2G.1 Diagnostic cleanup | Implemented locally Apr 29: removed visible dashboard diagnostic panel and noisy `[noor-api]` logs while keeping readable errors/fallbacks. | `artifacts/noor-mobile/src/lib/api.ts`, `app/child/[childId]/index.tsx` | None | JS-only | Local typecheck + `git diff --check` passed; hardware dashboard refresh, fallback, Targets route pending |
| 2G.2 Mobile IA shell | Add a child-level nav shell or More screen so existing and upcoming pages are discoverable. Use review badge if cheap. | `app/child/[childId]/_layout.tsx`, `index.tsx`, new `more.tsx`, possible `src/components/child-nav.tsx` | `GET /children/:id`, `GET /reviews` for badge/hide flags | JS-only | Hardware tab/stack navigation, back behavior, deep links to existing routes |
| 2G.3 Shared screen primitives | Establish mobile header/card/empty/error/filter patterns to avoid one-off thin screens. | New `artifacts/noor-mobile/src/components/*`, touched route files as adopted | None | JS-only | Visual pass on iPhone small/large text, loading/error states |
| 2G.4 API parity checklist | Align OpenAPI/backend assumptions before content pages. Document and then fix generated-client inputs through spec/codegen only. | `lib/api-spec/openapi.yaml`, route files if needed, generated output via Orval only | Dua status bug, `reviewedToday`, dashboard/reading fields | Mostly JS/TS; no native | API smoke tests; codegen/typecheck after actual implementation |

#### Phase 2H — Must-have mobile parity before TestFlight

Pre-TestFlight: yes, unless Mohammad explicitly narrows beta to existing seeded profiles.

| Slice | Goal | Likely files | Backend/API deps | Risk | QA |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2H.1 Mobile onboarding/profile management | Let parents create/edit/delete child profiles on mobile, including prior memorized surahs, initial strength/known ayahs, daily targets, practice minutes, and hide stories/duas. | `app/index.tsx`, new child create/edit/settings routes, `src/lib/api.ts`, possible shared form components | `POST/PUT/DELETE /children`, `GET /surahs`; may need OpenAPI updates | JS-only | Create child, seed progress/reviews, edit targets/settings, delete confirmation on test child |
| 2H.2 Dashboard parity content | Bring mobile dashboard close to web: stats, goals preview, achievements preview, story/dua cards, next/up-next work, richer completed/empty states, quick actions. | `app/child/[childId]/index.tsx`, shared dashboard components | Existing `GET /dashboard`; maybe `GET /goals` | JS-only | Hardware with hide flags on/off, complete/in-progress/not-started states |
| 2H.3 Settings/targets convergence | Expand Targets into parent settings: practice minutes, content visibility, child profile edit, daily presets, default memorization session settings, and fix profile settings persistence. | `targets.tsx`, new settings/profile route, `src/lib/settings.ts`, `memorization.tsx` only for persistence wiring | `PUT /children/:id`, `PUT /goals` if custom goals included | JS-only | Save/return/force close/reopen persistence QA |
| 2H.4 Review essentials parity | Add upcoming queue, reviewed/completed states, better empty/fallback UI, sticky/floating session controls, reciter/speed in review session, and route refresh after submit. | `review.tsx`, `review-session.tsx`, `src/lib/reviews.ts`, `src/lib/reciters.ts` | Existing reviews endpoints; OpenAPI should include `reviewedToday` | JS-only | Submit 0-5 ratings, queue refresh, no due reviews, upcoming visible |
| 2H.5 Reading essentials parity | Add page/surah/juz jump/search, saved-page resume clarity, reading target progress, better footer/header controls, and maybe simple bookmarks if still JS-only. | `mushaf.tsx`, `src/lib/mushaf.ts`, `src/lib/quran.ts`, possible static surah metadata helper | `POST /reading-progress`, `GET /dashboard`; no generated edits | JS-only | Swipe/save/resume, jump by page/surah/juz, reading goal completion |
| 2H.6 Memorization discovery parity | Add a mobile memorization home/list so users can search/filter surahs, see progress/strength, start today's work, resume in-progress work, and enter the existing session engine. | Existing `memorization.tsx` may need split into home/session routes; `src/lib/memorization.ts`; new progress components | `GET /surahs`, `GET /children/:id/memorization`, `GET /dashboard` | JS-only; careful route migration | Start from dashboard and list; current assignment still works; mark-complete persists |

#### Phase 2I — Rich learning/content pages

Pre-TestFlight: optional after 2H triage; good beta candidate if time.

| Slice | Goal | Likely files | Backend/API deps | Risk | QA |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2I.1 Stories | Mobile stories list/detail with categories, age filtering, morals, discussion questions, and dashboard/More entry points respecting `hideStories`. | New `stories.tsx`, `story-detail.tsx`, More/dashboard links | `GET /stories`, `GET /stories/:id`, child hide flag | JS-only | Category filter, detail, hidden state |
| 2I.2 Du'aas | Mobile du'aas list/detail/status with category filter, learned toggle, practice count, Arabic/transliteration/translation/source. | New `duas.tsx`, shared content cards | Fix `POST /children/:childId/duas` to key by `duaId`; OpenAPI/codegen if using generated client later | JS/backend; no native | Toggle multiple du'as independently, practice count, hidden state |
| 2I.3 Plan/goals | Mobile learning plan with age-group description, weekly goals, milestones, long-term goals, reset-to-auto, and practice minutes. | New `plan.tsx`, possible `goals.tsx`, More/dashboard links | `GET /plan`, `GET/PUT /goals`, `PUT /children` | JS-only | Toddler/child/preteen/teen plans; reset goals |
| 2I.4 Lesson/surah detail | Mobile lesson/surah detail cards with Arabic, transliteration, translation, tafsir brief, audio entry, and memorization handoff. Tajweed notes stay backlog. | New `lesson.tsx`, `surah-detail.tsx`; `src/lib/quran.ts` | `GET /surahs/:id`, Quran.com fetchers | JS-only | Open from plan/memorization; audio/translation loads |

#### Phase 2J — Progress/achievements/parent dashboard

Pre-TestFlight: some dashboard widgets are 2H; full analytics can be beta/post-beta.

| Slice | Goal | Likely files | Backend/API deps | Risk | QA |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2J.1 Progress page | Stats, weekly bars, earned/in-progress achievements, memorized surah list, review strength, daily progress bars. Use simple RN bars before adding chart libs. | New `progress.tsx`, dashboard widgets | `GET /dashboard`, `GET /weekly-progress`, `GET /memorization` | JS-only; avoid chart native deps | Empty/new child, active child, completed surahs |
| 2J.2 Sessions/goals history | Recent sessions, monthly/weekly activity, goals detail/edit, custom goals if needed. | New `sessions.tsx` or sections inside progress/plan | `GET/POST /sessions`, `GET/PUT /goals` | JS-only | Session list, goal persistence |
| 2J.3 Parent overview | Improve profile picker into a parent dashboard with multi-child cards, aggregate progress, quick settings, add child. | `app/index.tsx`, onboarding routes | `GET /children`, per-child dashboard if needed | JS-only | Multiple children, no children, sign-out |

#### Phase 2K — Polish + TestFlight readiness

Pre-TestFlight: yes after 2H must-haves are triaged/completed.

| Slice | Goal | Likely files | Backend/API deps | Risk | QA |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2K.1 Visual polish pass | Apply richer web-inspired product feel across mobile: section hierarchy, badges, compact stats, empty states, kid-friendly but parent-usable colors, no marketing hero. | All touched mobile screens, shared components | None | JS-only | Hardware screenshots of every primary screen |
| 2K.2 App shell/assets | Final app icon/splash, bundle/version config, production API env, no temporary dev copy. | `app.json`, assets, EAS config | None | App config changes may require EAS rebuild | Install production build, launch smoke |
| 2K.3 TestFlight build/QA | Production EAS build, App Store Connect/TestFlight setup, QA matrix, beta notes. | `artifacts/noor-mobile/*`, docs | Backend production stability | Requires production build | Login, onboarding, dashboard, memorize, recite, review, read, settings, content, offline/error paths |

---

## ✅ DONE — Infrastructure

- Apple Developer Program approved + App Store Connect access granted
- Backend deployed: <https://workspaceapi-server-production-cc25.up.railway.app>
- `BETTER_AUTH_URL` set to production URL
- `PROD_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` + `PROD_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` configured for CORS / Better Auth
- `/api/healthz` returns `{"status":"ok"}` (public, mounted above `requireAuth`)
- Three secrets rotated (Neon password, Better Auth secret, Hugging Face token)
- Branch-sync note: `main` + `feature/main-working-branch` were synced at `c57773f` before Phase 2G.1. After this cleanup commit, both branches should be synced to the current Phase 2G.1 HEAD. `safe-cumulative` was temporary archaeology and can be ignored.
- Typecheck baseline clean
- iOS bundle identifier registered: `com.mothman.noorpath`
- EAS project created at `@mothman123/noor-mobile`
- iOS distribution certificate generated (expires Apr 27 2027)
- `eas.json` committed with `development` / `preview` / `production` profiles
- `expo-dev-client` installed (auto-added by EAS during first dev build)
- First EAS development build shipped Apr 27 2026 — installed on registered iPhone, used to validate Slice 4 + Slice 5a Sessions 1+2

---

## ✅ DONE — Rendering architecture decided

| Context | Renderer | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| **Full Mushaf reader** | Page images + ayah bounding boxes | Authentic, pixel-perfect, zero rendering code |
| **Review** | Page images + highlight overlay on reviewed ayah range | Same visual the child memorized from; no layout work |
| **Memorization mode** | RN `<Text>` per word + Amiri Quran font + audio-synced highlight | Word-level granularity for follow-along audio |

**Two renderers, three contexts.** Page images do double duty for Full Mushaf and Review (the latter just adds an overlay highlighting the in-scope ayahs). Memorization is the only screen that needs custom text rendering, and that's where word-level interactivity actually matters.

**Why pages images for Review (not RN Text):** the child memorizes from a specific visual layout. Testing them on a different layout (different line breaks, different positions) would hurt recall. Page images keep the visual identical to the source they memorized from.

**Why not Skia anywhere:** Skia's basic `<Text>` doesn't shape Arabic correctly (renders disconnected isolated glyphs LTR — verified on iPhone). Skia's Paragraph API would shape correctly but require 4-8 weeks of building a custom renderer. Not justified.

**Memorization font: Amiri Quran.** Validated on iPhone Apr 27 against Digital Khatt and iOS system default. Amiri renders all Quran words correctly including the shadda+vowel sequences that Digital Khatt breaks on (verses 1, 3, 5 of Al-Fatihah). 133 KB, OFL license.

---

## ✅ DONE — Phase 1A: Mobile app skeleton + auth

Commits: `1c881c1`, `bc6115c`

- ✅ `artifacts/noor-mobile/` created (Expo SDK 54, Expo Router 6, RN 0.81.5)
- ✅ Renamed to `@workspace/noor-mobile` (matches monorepo convention)
- ✅ Migrated to pnpm-only (deleted `package-lock.json`, regenerated `pnpm-lock.yaml`)
- ✅ Better Auth client wired up via `@better-auth/expo` + `expo-secure-store`
- ✅ Sign-in screen working end-to-end against Railway backend
- ✅ Sign-out works
- ✅ Session persisted in iOS Keychain via SecureStore
- ✅ Light mode forced (`userInterfaceStyle: "light"` in app.json)

---

## ✅ DONE — Phase 1B: Child profile selector + dashboard skeleton

Commits: `ba10fc9`, `de6a2ae`

- ✅ `src/lib/api.ts` — typed `apiFetch<T>` helper using native `fetch`
- ✅ Session cookie attached via `authClient.getCookie()` (RN-specific Better Auth pattern)
- ✅ Child profile selector at `app/index.tsx`
- ✅ Dashboard at `app/child/[childId]/index.tsx` — three feature cards (Memorization, Review, Reading)
- ✅ All 8 children load on iPhone

---

## 🔜 Phase 1C — optional cleanup, deferred

Settings screen, du'aas list, stories list, achievements/progress. Low-priority; skipped to focus on memorization core. Pick up in a quiet later session.

---

## ✅ DONE — Phase 2A/B/C — page-image renderer + Reading + Review

### Phase 2A — Page image foundation

Validated and shipped in 2B (`4432f21`). Streaming from `raw.githubusercontent.com/GovarJabbar/Quran-PNG`, RTL paging via FlatList `inverted`, page-image cache via `<Image>` automatic. No bundling needed.

### Phase 2B — Full Mushaf reader (`4432f21`)

Reading card on dashboard navigates to a working Mushaf reader. 604 pages stream, RTL paging works, jump buttons (1/50/300/604), 2s debounced auto-save on swipe, last-page-read persists per child. Verified on iPhone.

### Phase 2C — Review screen (`bf8cb9a` + `08a8804` + `metro.config.js` fix)

Review queue loads with red/orange/green priority pills; surah review session shows mushaf page image + Husary audio + 0–5 quality rating modal; submit hits SM-2 backend and updates schedule. Verified on iPhone.

---

## ✅ DONE — Phase 2D — Memorization mode (Slices 1–4 + Slice 5a Sessions 1–3 local)

### Phase 2D-Core (Slice 1) — `5650d9e` + `e752721`

Single-verse focused memorization screen with Husary word-by-word audio sync.

### Phase 2D-Mushaf-Render (Slice 2a) — `1dae113`

Full Mushaf static view mode added.

### Phase 2D-Mushaf-Polish (Slice 2a-fix) — `3a9307c` + line-centering tweak

Visual repair of Slice 2a's wall-of-text rendering. Parchment page chrome ported from `noor-path` bayaan palette.

### Phase 2D-Mushaf-Sync (Slice 2b) — `ef7ae00`

Page-level audio sync + fixed controls island.

### Phase 2D-Practice (Slice 3) — `e2f9be7` + tweaks `1c89b3b`, `948de29`

Five settings + two mode buttons.

### Phase 2D-Recite (Slice 4) — `1f6557e` + docs `4100a1f`

On-device speech recognition via `expo-speech-recognition`. **Requires EAS dev build to test on hardware.**

#### Slice 4 hotfixes

- **v1 (`53675e6`)** — Audio session conflict + concurrent play race
- **v2 (`74ce890`)** — Web-derived Arabic matching + play-during-load race
- **v3 (`4b247eb`)** — Replay after natural finish + verse-boundary highlight + match logs

### Phase 2D-Polish Slice 5a Session 1 — `b73ed60` (initial) + 4 hotfixes

JS-only ship over existing EAS dev build.

**Initial commit `b73ed60`:**
- Diagnostic log cleanup from Slice 4 result handler
- `src/lib/reciters.ts` — 7-reciter table with `Reciter` type, `RECITERS` array, `findReciter`
- `src/lib/audio.ts` — `ayahAudioUrl(reciter, surah, ayah)` using `reciter.folder`
- `src/lib/memorization.ts` — initial parallel v4 chapter fetcher + `fetchTimingsForReciter` router (Husary→QDC, others→v4)
- `src/lib/mushaf-theme.ts` — 8-theme `THEMES` map, `ThemeKey`, `MushafTheme`, `THEME_DISPLAY_NAMES`, `DEFAULT_THEME_KEY`
- `memorization.tsx` — `makeThemedStyles(theme)` factory at module scope, `themedStyles = useMemo`, theme/reciter pill scrollers in settings sheet
- `src/lib/settings.ts` — initial `ChildSettings` blob persistence

**Hotfix sequence (post-hardware-testing):**

- **5a v1** — Audio session for iOS silent switch (`Audio.setAudioModeAsync({ playsInSilentModeIOS: true })`); fixed three wrong everyayah folders for Sudais/Minshawi/Ajmi (canonical names verified against everyayah.com); replaced bulk parallel v4 fetch with on-demand per-verse fetcher (`fetchQuranComV4VerseTiming` cached + dedup'd); split settings into profile-level (themeKey/reciterId/viewMode persisted) vs session-level (repeat/delay/autoplay/blur/blind reset each session). New `ChapterTimings` discriminated union type.
- **5a v2 (diagnostic)** — Added logs at `[v4-fetch]`, `[timings-effect]`, `[play]`, `[tick]` to debug missing word tracking.
- **5a v3 (`45d58a3`)** — Diagnostic logs revealed Quran.com v4 `by_ayah` endpoint returns `segments: undefined` for all non-Husary reciter IDs. Fix: fractional fallback in RAF tick (`Math.floor(frac * wordCount)`) when `segsRef.current` is empty. Mirrors web app's behavior. Plus `setVolumeAsync(1.0)` on every Sound (Afasy noticeably quieter than Husary on everyayah). Removed all diagnostic logs.
- **5a v4 (`d5d5f1f`)** — `LEAD_MS = 300` constant time-shift in fractional-fallback branch so highlight runs slightly ahead of audio (matches Husary's anticipatory feel from QDC segment 1 starting at frac=0).
- **5a v5** — Bumped `LEAD_MS = 500` after 300ms still trailed Afasy. Confirmed working for short ayahs. Lag may reappear on longer verses (Al-Baqarah, Ayat al-Kursi) — accepted limitation.

**Slice 5a Session 1 status: works very well on iPhone.** All 7 reciters play; word tracking works for all (true QDC for Husary, fractional fallback for others); audio plays through iPhone silent switch; volumes normalized; theme + reciter pickers in settings sheet; profile vs session settings split.

### Phase 2D-Polish Slice 5a Session 2 — `18f054d`

JS-only. Three features in one commit:

- **Translation popup (working)** — `word_fields=translation` + `translations=131` (Sahih International) added to both `fetchSurahVerses` and `fetchVersesByPage`. `onLongPress` (delayLongPress=400) on in-scope words opens a centered fade Modal with Arabic + English. Inner `Pressable` with empty `onPress` absorbs tap so backdrop dismiss only fires outside the card. Short tap still triggers tap-to-seek.
- **Playback rate (working)** — `PLAYBACK_RATES = [0.75, 0.85, 1.0, 1.15, 1.25, 1.5]` pill scroller in settings sheet (matches theme/reciter pattern). Skipped `@react-native-community/slider` since it has native code requiring a rebuild — discrete pill values are kid-friendlier anyway. `setRateAsync(rate, true)` (`shouldCorrectPitch=true`) called in `playVerse` after `createAsync`, plus a separate effect that pushes rate changes to the active sound mid-playback.
- **Tajweed coloring (broken — backlogged)** — created `src/lib/tajweed.ts` with 21-class `TAJWEED_COLORS` map and `extractTajweedColor` helper, added `text_uthmani_tajweed?` to `ApiWord`, included it in `word_fields` of both fetchers, wired tajweed toggle into settings sheet, applied colors via `extractTajweedColor` in both ayah and page word renderers. End markers and out-of-scope words skip coloring. **Doesn't visually color anything on hardware.** Likely cause: Quran.com v4 doesn't actually populate `text_uthmani_tajweed` as a `word_field` despite docs (the web app uses verse-level `text_uthmani_tajweed` + `splitTajweedIntoWords` parser, suggesting it's only available at the verse level). Wiring is in place; investigation deferred.

### Phase 2D-Polish Slice 5a Session 3 — cumulative review — `safe-cumulative` / synced

JS-only. Hardware-tested by Mohammad and synced to `main` + `feature/main-working-branch` on Apr 28.

Current local commits:
- `4599dff` — web-style cumulative review state machine (`internalPhase: "single" | "cumulative"`, `cumAyahIdx`, `cumPass`, `cumUpTo`, `playingVerseNumber`, `reviewRepeatCount`)
- `2eaad4b` — skip handling fix: Next from newest single verse enters cumulative instead of skipping review
- `34d0172` — final-verse Next starts final cumulative review instead of completing immediately
- `2147b07` — final-verse Next button enabled when cumulative review can start
- `b2b3186` — normal repeated verses show `Pass X/Y · Verse A of B` in the header

Behavior now mirrors the web retention flow:
- `cumulativeReview` toggle defaults false each screen mount.
- `reviewRepeatCount` defaults 3 and ranges 1-10.
- After each new verse finishes its normal repeats, cumulative review plays `ayahStart..currentVerse` for `reviewRepeatCount` passes.
- During cumulative review, each verse plays once (no per-verse repeats).
- Header shows `Pass X/Y · Ayahs A-B` during cumulative review.
- Header shows `Pass X/Y · Verse A of B` during normal repeated single-verse playback.
- `Next` during cumulative exits cumulative and advances/completes; `Prev` during cumulative bails back to single phase.
- `Mark Complete` remains submit + success alert; cumulative review happens during memorization, not after submit.

Hardware QA status:
- Mohammad tested the final cumulative review fixes and repeat-pass header and approved moving to 5b.
- Branches were synced afterward: `origin/main` and `origin/feature/main-working-branch` advanced to `7e56509`.

### Phase 2D-Polish Slice 5b — `expo-blur` — `aa004ff`

Goal: real blur via `expo-blur`, replacing the current opacity fallback (`styles.mushafWordBlurred { opacity: 0.35 }`) used by `blurMode` in `memorization.tsx`.

Completed and hardware-tested:
- Installed `expo-blur@~15.0.8` in `@workspace/noor-mobile` using pnpm.
- Updated `memorization.tsx` page-mode word rendering to use a `BlurView` overlay for inactive in-scope words while audio is playing.
- Removed the old opacity fallback from blurred words.
- Preserved `Pressable` handlers so tap-to-seek and long-press translation still route through the same word wrapper.
- Ran `cd artifacts/noor-mobile && npx tsc --noEmit` clean.
- EAS development build finished: `cfb3f406-5fec-405a-a150-e525a96ecff2`.
- User installed/tested the build and reported "All done."
- Metro initially showed a stale `Unable to resolve "expo-blur"` bundle error after native install; restarting `npx expo start --dev-client --clear` with the new dev build resolved the expected native-dependency refresh path.

Phase 2D is complete. Tajweed remains wired-but-not-rendering and is intentionally backlogged.

---

## ✅ DONE — Phase 2E — dashboard polish & today's-work content

Implemented, typechecked, and hardware-tested Apr 28, 2026.

- Mobile dashboard now loads `/api/children/:id/dashboard` plus `/api/children/:id/reviews`.
- Memorization, Review, and Reading cards show today's concrete queued work/status.
- Dashboard review previews and review queue cards share red/orange/green priority colors via `src/lib/review-priority.ts`.
- Review queue cards now have priority-colored rails/backgrounds, not just text pills.
- Profile selector rows now show richer child details: avatar bubble, age label, streak, points, and arrow affordance.
- No native dependencies added. Tajweed untouched.
- Local QA: `cd artifacts/noor-mobile && npx tsc --noEmit` passed clean.
- Hardware QA: Mohammad checked the profile/dashboard/review priority polish on iPhone and said it looks good.

## ✅ DONE — Phase 2F — target-setting UI

Implemented, committed, typechecked, route-fixed, and hardware-tested Apr 28, 2026.

- Added a mobile Targets screen at `app/child/[childId]/targets.tsx`.
- Parents can set memorization, review, and reading pages-per-day per child.
- Uses existing backend fields: `memorizePagePerDay`, `reviewPagesPerDay`, `readPagesPerDay`.
- Preset chips match the web reference; minus/plus controls allow fine tuning without keyboard input.
- Child dashboard has a `Targets` header action and refreshes when returning from the Targets screen.
- Shared mobile `apiFetch` now sends `x-local-date` and normalizes HTML API failures into readable messages, so transient server errors do not render raw HTML in-app.
- Child dashboard retries `/api/children/:id/dashboard` once, then falls back to child/profile plus review queue data so the dashboard remains usable and Targets stays reachable if today's plan endpoint flakes.
- No native dependencies added. Tajweed untouched.
- Local QA: `cd artifacts/noor-mobile && npx tsc --noEmit` passed clean after the target UI, after the API helper hotfix, and after the dashboard fallback.
- Production QA: authenticated production dashboard fetches for child L and Joll returned 200 after the screenshots, so the saved target values are not corrupting dashboard data.
- Hardware QA: Mohammad reported the Targets/dashboard route fix passed on iPhone; dashboard no longer gets stuck on `/api/children/targets/*`.

## 🔜 NEXT — Phase 2G web parity foundation

1. Hardware spot-check Phase 2G.1 on iPhone: dashboard normal load/refresh, Targets navigation, and fallback behavior.
2. Mark Phase 2G.1 hardware-tested after Mohammad confirms it.
3. Add the mobile IA shell/More screen so existing and upcoming pages are discoverable.
4. Start Phase 2H must-have mobile parity only after Phase 2G foundation lands.

---

## ⏸ Phase 3 — TestFlight & polish deferred

Phase 3/TestFlight is intentionally deferred until Phase 2H must-have mobile parity is triaged and completed, or explicitly moved to post-beta by Mohammad. The TestFlight work remains:

- [ ] App icon, splash screen, launch screen
- [ ] Production API/env review
- [ ] EAS Build production profile → first `.ipa`
- [ ] App Store Connect setup
- [ ] TestFlight beta with wife + trusted users
- [ ] Bug fixes from beta feedback
- [ ] App Store submission
- [ ] Push notifications for review reminders (Expo Notifications) — requires explicit native/build approval if new native config is needed
- [ ] Native gestures + haptics only if already covered by installed dependencies or explicitly approved
- [ ] Make audio controls in `review-session` sticky / floating at bottom of screen
- [ ] Add ayah-bounding-box overlay in `review-session`
- [ ] Migrate from `expo-av` to `expo-audio`/`expo-video` later; do not block parity on this

## 🟡 Backlog

- **Tajweed coloring not rendering (Slice 5a Session 2)** — wiring is in place (`src/lib/tajweed.ts`, fetcher fields, toggle, both renderers) but no colors appear on hardware. Most likely Quran.com v4 doesn't expose `text_uthmani_tajweed` as a `word_field` — only as a verse-level field. Web app uses `splitTajweedIntoWords` to parse the verse-level HTML and split into per-word HTML chunks. Mobile fix path: (1) add `fields=text_uthmani_tajweed` (verse-level) to fetcher, (2) port `splitTajweedIntoWords` from `noor-path/src/components/mushaf/bayaan/bayaan-utils.ts` to mobile, (3) at fetch time, parse each verse's tajweed HTML into a `Map<wordIdx, color>` keyed by display index, (4) consult that map in the renderers instead of `word.text_uthmani_tajweed`. Lower priority — kid can memorize fine without it.
- **Persistence bug** — Slice 5a Session 1 split profile vs session settings, but profile-level still doesn't persist across app close. Likely a hydrate-effect ordering issue or `settingsLoaded` gate timing problem in `memorization.tsx`. Low priority per user.
- **Long-verse fractional lag** — `LEAD_MS = 500` works for short ayahs but trailing reappears on long verses (Al-Baqarah, Ayat al-Kursi). Root cause is equal-time-per-word approximation, not leading silence. Real fix requires per-word audio durations (Quran.com `wbw` endpoint or similar) — heavier work. Accepted limitation for now.
- Update `noor-path/src/lib/auth-client.ts` to support env-switchable baseURL
- Add Expo dev URL to `PROD_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` and `PROD_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` if RN dev needs LAN access
- Retire `feature/main-working-branch` once `main` becomes permanent working branch
- Delete `~/Desktop/skia-quran-test/` (no longer needed)
- Dashboard kid name shows just first letter when truncated (cosmetic, low priority)
- Investigate continuous-listening latency on slow networks once recite mode sees more real-world use
- Web-app parity deep dive completed Apr 28, 2026. Follow the Phase 2G-2K roadmap above before resuming Phase 3/TestFlight.

## 📚 Knowledge banked

### From infra session
- pnpm 10's `pnpm-workspace.yaml` overrides syntax doesn't work with pnpm 9. Use root `package.json`'s `pnpm.overrides` for compat.
- Railway/Railpack reads `packageManager` field for Corepack activation but ignores it for version selection.
- Railway's "Wait for CI" toggle silently blocks all webhook-triggered deploys when no GitHub Actions are configured.
- Railway's "Redeploy" replays a row's specific commit + config, NOT branch HEAD.
- Native fetch from RN sends no `Origin` header — existing CORS `if (!origin)` branch handles it.

### From rendering test
- RN's `<Text>` shapes Arabic correctly via the OS text engine when given a real Unicode font (Amiri). No HarfBuzz/Skia needed.
- Skia's basic `<Text>` does NOT shape Arabic — renders isolated glyphs LTR.
- Reanimated v4 was split: needs `react-native-worklets` as separate peer dep (added in Expo SDK 54, Sep 2025).
- Expo Go bundles Skia/Reanimated/Worklets for testing; production needs EAS Build (full Xcode required).

### From Phase 1 mobile app setup
- React Native has no `document.cookie`. `credentials: "include"` in `fetch` does nothing. Better Auth Expo pattern: `authClient.getCookie()` returns the cookie string from SecureStore, which must be manually added as `Cookie` header. With manual `Cookie` header, set `credentials: "omit"` (not "include") to avoid conflicts.
- `npx expo install` in a pnpm monorepo will run `pnpm add` at the workspace root, which can corrupt nested `node_modules` if there's also an `npm install` `package-lock.json` present. Fix: commit fully to pnpm.
- `@better-auth/expo@1.6.9` requires `expo-network` as a peer dependency. Not installed automatically.
- pnpm's `node_modules/.pnpm/` content-addressed store works fine with Metro/Expo without `node-linker=hoisted`.
- App-wide light mode: set `"userInterfaceStyle": "light"` in `app.json` AND use explicit colors in StyleSheet.

### From QPC font test (2026-04-27)
- QPC V1/V2 per-page fonts use Private Use Area codepoints, not real Unicode. Each word on a Mushaf page is encoded as a custom glyph at a PUA codepoint.
- Decision: NOT pursuing QPC font rendering. Sticking with PNG page images for Full Mushaf + Review.

### From page-image streaming test (2026-04-27)
- Streaming Mushaf pages from `raw.githubusercontent.com/GovarJabbar/Quran-PNG` works on iOS via `<Image>` + `<FlatList>`.
- URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GovarJabbar/Quran-PNG/master/{NNN}.png` (NNN zero-padded 001–604).
- Page aspect ratio ~1.45:1.
- For RTL navigation use FlatList with `inverted` prop.

### Metro + pnpm requires explicit config (2026-04-27)
- When adding native dependencies, Metro with pnpm-style symlinks fails to resolve packages by default.
- Fix: `artifacts/noor-mobile/metro.config.js` must set `config.watchFolders = [workspaceRoot]` and `config.resolver.nodeModulesPaths = [projectRoot/node_modules, workspaceRoot/node_modules]`.
- DO NOT set `disableHierarchicalLookup: true` — pnpm's deeply nested `.pnpm/` requires hierarchical lookup ON.
- After modifying `metro.config.js`, restart with `npx expo start --clear`.

### Memorization screen architecture (2026-04-27, Phase 2D + Slice 5a)
- One file: `app/child/[childId]/memorization.tsx`. ~1500 lines after Slice 5a Session 2.
- Audio state lives in refs because `expo-av` status callback closes over stale state. Pattern: `const fooRef = useRef(foo); useEffect(() => { fooRef.current = foo; }, [foo]);`
- Audio refs as of Slice 5a Session 2: `viewModeRef`, `currentVerseRef`, `ayahEndRef`, `isPlayingRef`, `isLoadingRef`, `pendingSeekPositionRef`, `repeatCountRef`, `autoAdvanceDelayRef`, `autoplayThroughRangeRef`, `reciteModeRef`, `reciteExpectedIdxRef`, `displayWordsMapRef`, `surahNumberRef`, `matchedWordCountRef`, `lastMatchedWordRef`, `lastMatchTimeRef`, `reciterRef`, `saveTimerRef`, `playbackRateRef`. Plus timer/raf/sound refs.
- Two render modes (`viewMode: "ayah" | "page"`). Two highlight states (`highlightedWord` for ayah, `highlightedPage: { verseKey, position }` for page).
- QDC segments are 1-indexed and skip non-word tokens (filter `char_type_name === "word"` first).
- Husary `qdcId: 6`, `quranComId: null`. Don't assume null `quranComId` means no timing data.
- iOS audio session conflict: `expo-av` and `expo-speech-recognition` can't both hold the session. `pauseAsync()` not enough — must `unloadAsync()`. `stopAudioCompletely()` is the single cleanup point.

### Reciter audio infrastructure (2026-04-27, Slice 5a Session 1)
- 7 reciters in `src/lib/reciters.ts`: husary, afasy, sudais, basit, minshawi, ghamdi, ajmi.
- everyayah folder names verified against the canonical `everyayah.com/recitations_pages.html` list. Three names in the original web table were stale: Sudais (`Sudais_192kbps` → `Abdurrahmaan_As-Sudais_192kbps`), Minshawi (`Minshawi_Murattal_128kbps` → `Minshawy_Murattal_128kbps` with y), Ajmi (`ahmed_ibn_ali_al-ajmy128kbps` → `Ahmed_ibn_Ali_al-Ajamy_128kbps_ketaballah.net`).
- Quran.com v4 `by_ayah` endpoint returns `segments: undefined` for all 6 non-Husary reciter IDs (verified via diagnostic logging Apr 27). Web app uses same endpoint and gets same empty result — falls back to fractional approximation.
- Fractional fallback in `tick()`: `Math.floor(shiftedFrac * wordCount)` where `shiftedFrac = (pos + LEAD_MS) / dur, clamped to 1`. `LEAD_MS = 500` after tuning. Provides anticipatory feel similar to Husary's QDC segment 1 starting at frac=0.
- iOS audio session: `Audio.setAudioModeAsync({ playsInSilentModeIOS: true })` mandatory — without it the silent switch silences playback through the speaker. AirPods always work because Bluetooth bypasses the switch.
- everyayah recordings have wildly different mastered volumes. Afasy_128kbps is significantly quieter than Husary_128kbps. Compensate with `setVolumeAsync(1.0)` on every Sound after `createAsync`.
- `setRateAsync(rate, /* shouldCorrectPitch */ true)` works on `expo-av` Sound. Range 0.75–1.5 is comfortable. `shouldCorrectPitch=true` keeps recitation pitch natural.

### Profile vs session settings (2026-04-27, Slice 5a Session 1)
- `src/lib/settings.ts` exports `loadProfileSettings`/`saveProfileSettings` (themeKey, reciterId, viewMode — persisted to AsyncStorage) and `DEFAULT_SESSION_SETTINGS` constants (repeatCount, autoAdvanceDelayMs, autoplayThroughRange, blurMode, blindMode — reset each session).
- Profile-level edited via future Profile Settings page (Phase 2E). For now, defaults hardcoded.
- Session 2 added `playbackRate` and `tajweedEnabled` as plain inline `useState` defaults (not added to `DEFAULT_SESSION_SETTINGS`); they reset on screen mount.
- Persistence currently buggy — profile settings don't survive app close. Likely hydrate-effect ordering. Low priority per user.

### Tajweed (2026-04-27, Slice 5a Session 2 — partial)
- `src/lib/tajweed.ts` has the 21-class `TAJWEED_COLORS` map (ported from `noor-path/src/components/mushaf/bayaan/bayaan-constants.ts` `TAJWEED_CSS`) plus `extractTajweedColor(html)` which extracts the first `class="..."` and looks up the hex.
- Mobile assumed Quran.com v4 supports `text_uthmani_tajweed` as a `word_field`. On hardware no colors render. Likely the field isn't populated at the word level — only at verse level (web app fetches `text_uthmani_tajweed` on the verse and uses `splitTajweedIntoWords` from `bayaan-utils.ts` to chunk it). Fix path documented in backlog.

### Translation popup (2026-04-27, Slice 5a Session 2)
- Quran.com v4 `word_fields=translation` + `translations=131` (Sahih International) populates a `translation` field on each word. May come back as a `{ text, language_name }` object OR a plain string — handle both.
- `onLongPress` with `delayLongPress={400}` is a comfortable threshold (short tap still fires `onPress`).
- RN backdrop-dismiss pattern: outer `Pressable` is the backdrop with `onPress={close}`; inner card is also a `Pressable` with `onPress={() => {}}` (empty) to absorb taps so they don't bubble to the backdrop. Plain `<View>` for the card would let taps fall through.

### Arabic fuzzy matching for on-device speech recognition (2026-04-27, Slice 4 hotfixes)
- iOS speech recognition returns plain Arabic — no hamza variants (أإآاٱ all collapse to ا), no ta-marbuta (ة → ه), no ya-with-hamza (ئ → ي), often without "ال" prefix.
- The web app's `stripTashkeel` does the full normalization.
- Multi-predicate match: equality, substring either direction, subsequence either direction, noun-vowel-stripped equality, word-final ت→ه swap. `ال` prefix stripping with ≥2-char fallback. 1-char heard tokens reject unless equal.
- iOS sends growing partial transcripts each event. Matcher walks full transcript from `matchedWordCountRef` forward.
- iOS recognition has 60s session limit + warm-up gibberish at restart. Multi-predicate matchers reject the gibberish naturally.

### EAS dev build (2026-04-27)
- Expo Go does not include native modules. Use `eas build --profile development --platform ios`.
- Use `npx eas-cli@latest <cmd>` (avoid global-install permission issues).
- iOS 16+ requires Developer Mode (Settings → Privacy & Security → Developer Mode → enable → restart).
- Trust developer profile in iPhone Settings → General → VPN & Device Management.
- Run dev server: `npx expo start --dev-client` (the `--dev-client` flag is critical).
- Re-run `eas build` only when adding new native deps or changing `app.json` plugin entries. Pure JS hot-reloads.
