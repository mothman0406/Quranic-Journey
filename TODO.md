# NoorPath / Quranic Journey — Status & Next Steps

_Last updated: April 28, 2026 (Phase 2F target-setting UI committed; API client local-date/error hardening committed at `ce8b9f6` and typechecked; production dashboard for child L returns 200; hardware re-QA pending)_

---

## Documentation rule for every new action

After every meaningful action, update this file and `PHASE_2D_HANDOFF.md` before handing off:

- Update the "Last updated" line with the date and actual current state.
- Record the active branch, latest local SHA, and whether remote branches are synced or stale.
- Move completed work out of "next" sections and into the done/current-state section.
- Add any hardware QA results or known failures immediately.
- Make the next action checklist concrete enough that a fresh Codex/Claude chat can start without reconstructing context.

## Current work log — April 28, 2026

- Active branch/SHA: `main`; Phase 2F target-setting UI commit is `fe83e97`; API client hardening commit is `ce8b9f6`; latest docs sync is current branch HEAD.
- Remote sync status: pending final push at the time of this docs edit; after sync, `main`, `origin/main`, `feature/main-working-branch`, and `origin/feature/main-working-branch` should all contain `ce8b9f6` plus this docs sync. `safe-cumulative` is intentionally behind and can be ignored.
- QA status: `cd artifacts/noor-mobile && npx tsc --noEmit` passed clean after Phase 2F edits and again after the API client hardening hotfix. Production `/api/children/23/dashboard` returned 200 with the active Better Auth session after the user screenshot showed a transient API 500. Hardware re-QA is pending.
- Dev-server note: starting Expo inside the sandbox fails with `ERR_SOCKET_BAD_PORT` because sandboxed Node cannot bind local ports (`EPERM` on 8081). Run the dev server outside the sandbox/escalated when using this environment.
- Inspection notes: initial Phase 2E inspection found `app/child/[childId]/index.tsx` was a three-card skeleton; `src/lib/api.ts` is a thin authenticated fetch helper; `/api/children/:id/dashboard` exposes `todaysPlan.newMemorization`, `todayProgress`, `reviewsDueToday`, and `readingGoal`; `/api/children/:id/reviews` exposes detailed queue items with `reviewPriority`.
- Implementation notes: mobile dashboard now fetches dashboard plus review queue data, the Memorization/Review/Reading cards show today's assigned work, review previews use shared red/orange/green priority styling, the review queue cards have matching priority rails/backgrounds, and the profile selector has richer child rows with age, streak, and points.
- Diff-review notes: removed new dashboard letter spacing and fixed streak pluralization before final QA.
- Phase 2F inspection notes: targets are stored on `children` as `memorizePagePerDay`, `reviewPagesPerDay`, and `readPagesPerDay`; `GET /api/children/:childId` returns them through `formatChild`; `PUT /api/children/:childId` accepts all three fields. Web reference options live in `artifacts/noor-path/src/pages/settings.tsx`.
- Phase 2F implementation notes: added `app/child/[childId]/targets.tsx`, registered it in the child stack, added a dashboard `Targets` entry point, and made the dashboard refresh on focus after returning from target edits. The screen uses preset chips plus minus/plus fine tuning and saves directly through `apiFetch`.
- Phase 2F hotfix notes: after a screenshot showed the dashboard rendering raw HTML from an API 500, production was checked directly and returned 200 for child L. `apiFetch` now sends `x-local-date` from the phone and normalizes JSON/plain-text/HTML failures into short readable error messages instead of showing full HTML documents.
- Exact next checklist:
  1. Sync `main` and `feature/main-working-branch` after this docs refresh.
  2. Ask Mohammad to tap Retry/reopen L's dashboard in the existing dev client.
  3. Re-test `Targets`: change memorization, review, and reading targets; confirm saved indicators.
  4. Return to the dashboard and verify the cards reflect the saved target values.
  5. If approved, move to Phase 3 TestFlight polish or the planned web-app deep dive.

## ✅ DONE — Rendering architecture decided

| Context | Renderer | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| **Full Mushaf reader** | Page images + ayah bounding boxes | Authentic, pixel-perfect, zero rendering code |
| **Review** | Page images + highlight overlay on reviewed ayah range | Same visual the child memorized from; no layout work |
| **Memorization mode** | RN `<Text>` per word + Amiri Quran font + audio-synced highlight | Word-level granularity for follow-along audio |

**Two renderers, three contexts.** Page images do double duty for Full Mushaf and Review (the latter just adds an overlay highlighting the in-scope ayahs). Memorization is the only screen that needs custom text rendering, and that's where word-level interactivity actually matters.

**Why pages images for Review (not RN Text):** the child memorizes from a specific visual layout. Testing them on a different layout (different line breaks, different positions) would hurt recall. Page images keep the visual identical to the source they memorized from.

**Why not Skia anywhere:** Skia's basic `<Text>` doesn't shape Arabic correctly (renders disconnected isolated glyphs LTR — verified on iPhone). Skia's Paragraph API would shape correctly but require 4-8 weeks of building a custom renderer. Not justified.

**Memorization font: Amiri Quran.** Validated on iPhone Apr 27 against Digital Khatt and iOS system default. Amiri renders all Quran words correctly including the shadda+vowel sequences that Digital Khatt breaks on (verses 1, 3, 5 of Al-Fatihah). 133 KB, OFL license.

## ✅ DONE — Phase 1A: Mobile app skeleton + auth

Commits: `1c881c1`, `bc6115c`

- ✅ `artifacts/noor-mobile/` created (Expo SDK 54, Expo Router 6, RN 0.81.5)
- ✅ Renamed to `@workspace/noor-mobile` (matches monorepo convention)
- ✅ Migrated to pnpm-only (deleted `package-lock.json`, regenerated `pnpm-lock.yaml`)
- ✅ Better Auth client wired up via `@better-auth/expo` + `expo-secure-store`
- ✅ Sign-in screen working end-to-end against Railway backend
- ✅ Sign-out works
- ✅ Session persisted in iOS Keychain via SecureStore
- ✅ Light mode forced (`userInterfaceStyle: "light"` in app.json)

---

## ✅ DONE — Phase 1B: Child profile selector + dashboard skeleton

Commits: `ba10fc9`, `de6a2ae`

- ✅ `src/lib/api.ts` — typed `apiFetch<T>` helper using native `fetch`
- ✅ Session cookie attached via `authClient.getCookie()` (RN-specific Better Auth pattern)
- ✅ Child profile selector at `app/index.tsx`
- ✅ Dashboard at `app/child/[childId]/index.tsx` — three feature cards (Memorization, Review, Reading)
- ✅ All 8 children load on iPhone

---

## 🔜 Phase 1C — optional cleanup, deferred

Settings screen, du'aas list, stories list, achievements/progress. Low-priority; skipped to focus on memorization core. Pick up in a quiet later session.

---

## ✅ DONE — Phase 2A/B/C — page-image renderer + Reading + Review

### Phase 2A — Page image foundation

Validated and shipped in 2B (`4432f21`). Streaming from `raw.githubusercontent.com/GovarJabbar/Quran-PNG`, RTL paging via FlatList `inverted`, page-image cache via `<Image>` automatic. No bundling needed.

### Phase 2B — Full Mushaf reader (`4432f21`)

Reading card on dashboard navigates to a working Mushaf reader. 604 pages stream, RTL paging works, jump buttons (1/50/300/604), 2s debounced auto-save on swipe, last-page-read persists per child. Verified on iPhone.

### Phase 2C — Review screen (`bf8cb9a` + `08a8804` + `metro.config.js` fix)

Review queue loads with red/orange/green priority pills; surah review session shows mushaf page image + Husary audio + 0–5 quality rating modal; submit hits SM-2 backend and updates schedule. Verified on iPhone.

---

## ✅ DONE — Phase 2D — Memorization mode (Slices 1–4 + Slice 5a Sessions 1–3 local)

### Phase 2D-Core (Slice 1) — `5650d9e` + `e752721`

Single-verse focused memorization screen with Husary word-by-word audio sync.

### Phase 2D-Mushaf-Render (Slice 2a) — `1dae113`

Full Mushaf static view mode added.

### Phase 2D-Mushaf-Polish (Slice 2a-fix) — `3a9307c` + line-centering tweak

Visual repair of Slice 2a's wall-of-text rendering. Parchment page chrome ported from `noor-path` bayaan palette.

### Phase 2D-Mushaf-Sync (Slice 2b) — `ef7ae00`

Page-level audio sync + fixed controls island.

### Phase 2D-Practice (Slice 3) — `e2f9be7` + tweaks `1c89b3b`, `948de29`

Five settings + two mode buttons.

### Phase 2D-Recite (Slice 4) — `1f6557e` + docs `4100a1f`

On-device speech recognition via `expo-speech-recognition`. **Requires EAS dev build to test on hardware.**

#### Slice 4 hotfixes

- **v1 (`53675e6`)** — Audio session conflict + concurrent play race
- **v2 (`74ce890`)** — Web-derived Arabic matching + play-during-load race
- **v3 (`4b247eb`)** — Replay after natural finish + verse-boundary highlight + match logs

### Phase 2D-Polish Slice 5a Session 1 — `b73ed60` (initial) + 4 hotfixes

JS-only ship over existing EAS dev build.

**Initial commit `b73ed60`:**
- Diagnostic log cleanup from Slice 4 result handler
- `src/lib/reciters.ts` — 7-reciter table with `Reciter` type, `RECITERS` array, `findReciter`
- `src/lib/audio.ts` — `ayahAudioUrl(reciter, surah, ayah)` using `reciter.folder`
- `src/lib/memorization.ts` — initial parallel v4 chapter fetcher + `fetchTimingsForReciter` router (Husary→QDC, others→v4)
- `src/lib/mushaf-theme.ts` — 8-theme `THEMES` map, `ThemeKey`, `MushafTheme`, `THEME_DISPLAY_NAMES`, `DEFAULT_THEME_KEY`
- `memorization.tsx` — `makeThemedStyles(theme)` factory at module scope, `themedStyles = useMemo`, theme/reciter pill scrollers in settings sheet
- `src/lib/settings.ts` — initial `ChildSettings` blob persistence

**Hotfix sequence (post-hardware-testing):**

- **5a v1** — Audio session for iOS silent switch (`Audio.setAudioModeAsync({ playsInSilentModeIOS: true })`); fixed three wrong everyayah folders for Sudais/Minshawi/Ajmi (canonical names verified against everyayah.com); replaced bulk parallel v4 fetch with on-demand per-verse fetcher (`fetchQuranComV4VerseTiming` cached + dedup'd); split settings into profile-level (themeKey/reciterId/viewMode persisted) vs session-level (repeat/delay/autoplay/blur/blind reset each session). New `ChapterTimings` discriminated union type.
- **5a v2 (diagnostic)** — Added logs at `[v4-fetch]`, `[timings-effect]`, `[play]`, `[tick]` to debug missing word tracking.
- **5a v3 (`45d58a3`)** — Diagnostic logs revealed Quran.com v4 `by_ayah` endpoint returns `segments: undefined` for all non-Husary reciter IDs. Fix: fractional fallback in RAF tick (`Math.floor(frac * wordCount)`) when `segsRef.current` is empty. Mirrors web app's behavior. Plus `setVolumeAsync(1.0)` on every Sound (Afasy noticeably quieter than Husary on everyayah). Removed all diagnostic logs.
- **5a v4 (`d5d5f1f`)** — `LEAD_MS = 300` constant time-shift in fractional-fallback branch so highlight runs slightly ahead of audio (matches Husary's anticipatory feel from QDC segment 1 starting at frac=0).
- **5a v5** — Bumped `LEAD_MS = 500` after 300ms still trailed Afasy. Confirmed working for short ayahs. Lag may reappear on longer verses (Al-Baqarah, Ayat al-Kursi) — accepted limitation.

**Slice 5a Session 1 status: works very well on iPhone.** All 7 reciters play; word tracking works for all (true QDC for Husary, fractional fallback for others); audio plays through iPhone silent switch; volumes normalized; theme + reciter pickers in settings sheet; profile vs session settings split.

### Phase 2D-Polish Slice 5a Session 2 — `18f054d`

JS-only. Three features in one commit:

- **Translation popup (working)** — `word_fields=translation` + `translations=131` (Sahih International) added to both `fetchSurahVerses` and `fetchVersesByPage`. `onLongPress` (delayLongPress=400) on in-scope words opens a centered fade Modal with Arabic + English. Inner `Pressable` with empty `onPress` absorbs tap so backdrop dismiss only fires outside the card. Short tap still triggers tap-to-seek.
- **Playback rate (working)** — `PLAYBACK_RATES = [0.75, 0.85, 1.0, 1.15, 1.25, 1.5]` pill scroller in settings sheet (matches theme/reciter pattern). Skipped `@react-native-community/slider` since it has native code requiring a rebuild — discrete pill values are kid-friendlier anyway. `setRateAsync(rate, true)` (`shouldCorrectPitch=true`) called in `playVerse` after `createAsync`, plus a separate effect that pushes rate changes to the active sound mid-playback.
- **Tajweed coloring (broken — backlogged)** — created `src/lib/tajweed.ts` with 21-class `TAJWEED_COLORS` map and `extractTajweedColor` helper, added `text_uthmani_tajweed?` to `ApiWord`, included it in `word_fields` of both fetchers, wired tajweed toggle into settings sheet, applied colors via `extractTajweedColor` in both ayah and page word renderers. End markers and out-of-scope words skip coloring. **Doesn't visually color anything on hardware.** Likely cause: Quran.com v4 doesn't actually populate `text_uthmani_tajweed` as a `word_field` despite docs (the web app uses verse-level `text_uthmani_tajweed` + `splitTajweedIntoWords` parser, suggesting it's only available at the verse level). Wiring is in place; investigation deferred.

---

### Phase 2D-Polish Slice 5a Session 3 — cumulative review — `safe-cumulative` / synced

JS-only. Hardware-tested by Mohammad and synced to `main` + `feature/main-working-branch` on Apr 28.

Current local commits:
- `4599dff` — web-style cumulative review state machine (`internalPhase: "single" | "cumulative"`, `cumAyahIdx`, `cumPass`, `cumUpTo`, `playingVerseNumber`, `reviewRepeatCount`)
- `2eaad4b` — skip handling fix: Next from newest single verse enters cumulative instead of skipping review
- `34d0172` — final-verse Next starts final cumulative review instead of completing immediately
- `2147b07` — final-verse Next button enabled when cumulative review can start
- `b2b3186` — normal repeated verses show `Pass X/Y · Verse A of B` in the header

Behavior now mirrors the web retention flow:
- `cumulativeReview` toggle defaults false each screen mount.
- `reviewRepeatCount` defaults 3 and ranges 1-10.
- After each new verse finishes its normal repeats, cumulative review plays `ayahStart..currentVerse` for `reviewRepeatCount` passes.
- During cumulative review, each verse plays once (no per-verse repeats).
- Header shows `Pass X/Y · Ayahs A-B` during cumulative review.
- Header shows `Pass X/Y · Verse A of B` during normal repeated single-verse playback.
- `Next` during cumulative exits cumulative and advances/completes; `Prev` during cumulative bails back to single phase.
- `Mark Complete` remains submit + success alert; cumulative review happens during memorization, not after submit.

Hardware QA status:
- Mohammad tested the final cumulative review fixes and repeat-pass header and approved moving to 5b.
- Branches were synced afterward: `origin/main` and `origin/feature/main-working-branch` advanced to `7e56509`.

### Phase 2D-Polish Slice 5b — `expo-blur` — `aa004ff`

Goal: real blur via `expo-blur`, replacing the current opacity fallback (`styles.mushafWordBlurred { opacity: 0.35 }`) used by `blurMode` in `memorization.tsx`.

Completed and hardware-tested:
- Installed `expo-blur@~15.0.8` in `@workspace/noor-mobile` using pnpm.
- Updated `memorization.tsx` page-mode word rendering to use a `BlurView` overlay for inactive in-scope words while audio is playing.
- Removed the old opacity fallback from blurred words.
- Preserved `Pressable` handlers so tap-to-seek and long-press translation still route through the same word wrapper.
- Ran `cd artifacts/noor-mobile && npx tsc --noEmit` clean.
- EAS development build finished: `cfb3f406-5fec-405a-a150-e525a96ecff2`.
- User installed/tested the build and reported "All done."
- Metro initially showed a stale `Unable to resolve "expo-blur"` bundle error after native install; restarting `npx expo start --dev-client --clear` with the new dev build resolved the expected native-dependency refresh path.

Phase 2D is complete. Tajweed remains wired-but-not-rendering and is intentionally backlogged.

---

## ✅ DONE — Phase 2E — dashboard polish & today's-work content

Implemented, typechecked, and hardware-tested Apr 28, 2026.

- Mobile dashboard now loads `/api/children/:id/dashboard` plus `/api/children/:id/reviews`.
- Memorization, Review, and Reading cards show today's concrete queued work/status.
- Dashboard review previews and review queue cards share red/orange/green priority colors via `src/lib/review-priority.ts`.
- Review queue cards now have priority-colored rails/backgrounds, not just text pills.
- Profile selector rows now show richer child details: avatar bubble, age label, streak, points, and arrow affordance.
- No native dependencies added. Tajweed untouched.
- Local QA: `cd artifacts/noor-mobile && npx tsc --noEmit` passed clean.
- Hardware QA: Mohammad checked the profile/dashboard/review priority polish on iPhone and said it looks good.

## ✅ DONE LOCALLY — Phase 2F — target-setting UI

Implemented, committed, and typechecked Apr 28, 2026. Hardware re-QA is still pending after one transient dashboard 500 screenshot.

- Added a mobile Targets screen at `app/child/[childId]/targets.tsx`.
- Parents can set memorization, review, and reading pages-per-day per child.
- Uses existing backend fields: `memorizePagePerDay`, `reviewPagesPerDay`, `readPagesPerDay`.
- Preset chips match the web reference; minus/plus controls allow fine tuning without keyboard input.
- Child dashboard has a `Targets` header action and refreshes when returning from the Targets screen.
- Shared mobile `apiFetch` now sends `x-local-date` and normalizes HTML API failures into readable messages, so transient server errors do not render raw HTML in-app.
- No native dependencies added. Tajweed untouched.
- Local QA: `cd artifacts/noor-mobile && npx tsc --noEmit` passed clean after the target UI and again after the API helper hotfix.
- Production QA: authenticated production dashboard fetch for child L returned 200 after the screenshot, so the saved target values are not corrupting dashboard data.

## 🔜 NEXT — Phase 2F hardware QA

1. Start Metro with `npx expo start --dev-client --clear --port 8081` outside the sandbox/escalated.
2. Open the installed development build on iPhone.
3. Reopen L's dashboard or tap `Retry`; confirm the dashboard loads.
4. From a child dashboard, tap `Targets`.
5. Change memorization, review, and reading targets; confirm each save indicator appears.
6. Return to the dashboard and verify reading/review/memorization cards reflect the updated target data after refresh.
7. If approved, move to Phase 3 TestFlight polish or the planned web-app deep dive.

---

## 🔜 Phase 3 — TestFlight & polish

- [ ] Push notifications for review reminders (Expo Notifications)
- [ ] Native gestures + haptics
- [ ] App icon, splash screen, launch screen
- [ ] App Store Connect setup (only when there's an actual app to upload)
- [ ] EAS Build production profile → first .ipa
- [ ] TestFlight beta with wife + trusted users
- [ ] Bug fixes from beta feedback
- [ ] App Store submission
- [ ] Make audio controls in `review-session` sticky / floating at bottom of screen
- [ ] Add ayah-bounding-box overlay in `review-session`
- [ ] Migrate from `expo-av` to `expo-audio`/`expo-video` (deprecation warning surfaced in SDK 54)

**Estimated remaining: 3-5 weeks**

---

## 🟡 Backlog

- **Tajweed coloring not rendering (Slice 5a Session 2)** — wiring is in place (`src/lib/tajweed.ts`, fetcher fields, toggle, both renderers) but no colors appear on hardware. Most likely Quran.com v4 doesn't expose `text_uthmani_tajweed` as a `word_field` — only as a verse-level field. Web app uses `splitTajweedIntoWords` to parse the verse-level HTML and split into per-word HTML chunks. Mobile fix path: (1) add `fields=text_uthmani_tajweed` (verse-level) to fetcher, (2) port `splitTajweedIntoWords` from `noor-path/src/components/mushaf/bayaan/bayaan-utils.ts` to mobile, (3) at fetch time, parse each verse's tajweed HTML into a `Map<wordIdx, color>` keyed by display index, (4) consult that map in the renderers instead of `word.text_uthmani_tajweed`. Lower priority — kid can memorize fine without it.
- **Persistence bug** — Slice 5a Session 1 split profile vs session settings, but profile-level still doesn't persist across app close. Likely a hydrate-effect ordering issue or `settingsLoaded` gate timing problem in `memorization.tsx`. Low priority per user.
- **Long-verse fractional lag** — `LEAD_MS = 500` works for short ayahs but trailing reappears on long verses (Al-Baqarah, Ayat al-Kursi). Root cause is equal-time-per-word approximation, not leading silence. Real fix requires per-word audio durations (Quran.com `wbw` endpoint or similar) — heavier work. Accepted limitation for now.
- Update `noor-path/src/lib/auth-client.ts` to support env-switchable baseURL
- Add Expo dev URL to `PROD_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` and `PROD_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` if RN dev needs LAN access
- Retire `feature/main-working-branch` once `main` becomes permanent working branch
- Delete `~/Desktop/skia-quran-test/` (no longer needed)
- Dashboard kid name shows just first letter when truncated (cosmetic, low priority)
- Investigate continuous-listening latency on slow networks once recite mode sees more real-world use
- Deep-dive into web app's `noor-path/` for "lots of cool stuff that took a lot of work" — user wants this after Phase 2 completes

## 📚 Knowledge banked

### From infra session
- pnpm 10's `pnpm-workspace.yaml` overrides syntax doesn't work with pnpm 9. Use root `package.json`'s `pnpm.overrides` for compat.
- Railway/Railpack reads `packageManager` field for Corepack activation but ignores it for version selection.
- Railway's "Wait for CI" toggle silently blocks all webhook-triggered deploys when no GitHub Actions are configured.
- Railway's "Redeploy" replays a row's specific commit + config, NOT branch HEAD.
- Native fetch from RN sends no `Origin` header — existing CORS `if (!origin)` branch handles it.

### From rendering test
- RN's `<Text>` shapes Arabic correctly via the OS text engine when given a real Unicode font (Amiri). No HarfBuzz/Skia needed.
- Skia's basic `<Text>` does NOT shape Arabic — renders isolated glyphs LTR.
- Reanimated v4 was split: needs `react-native-worklets` as separate peer dep (added in Expo SDK 54, Sep 2025).
- Expo Go bundles Skia/Reanimated/Worklets for testing; production needs EAS Build (full Xcode required).

### From Phase 1 mobile app setup
- React Native has no `document.cookie`. `credentials: "include"` in `fetch` does nothing. Better Auth Expo pattern: `authClient.getCookie()` returns the cookie string from SecureStore, which must be manually added as `Cookie` header. With manual `Cookie` header, set `credentials: "omit"` (not "include") to avoid conflicts.
- `npx expo install` in a pnpm monorepo will run `pnpm add` at the workspace root, which can corrupt nested `node_modules` if there's also an `npm install` `package-lock.json` present. Fix: commit fully to pnpm.
- `@better-auth/expo@1.6.9` requires `expo-network` as a peer dependency. Not installed automatically.
- pnpm's `node_modules/.pnpm/` content-addressed store works fine with Metro/Expo without `node-linker=hoisted`.
- App-wide light mode: set `"userInterfaceStyle": "light"` in `app.json` AND use explicit colors in StyleSheet.

### From QPC font test (2026-04-27)
- QPC V1/V2 per-page fonts use Private Use Area codepoints, not real Unicode. Each word on a Mushaf page is encoded as a custom glyph at a PUA codepoint.
- Decision: NOT pursuing QPC font rendering. Sticking with PNG page images for Full Mushaf + Review.

### From page-image streaming test (2026-04-27)
- Streaming Mushaf pages from `raw.githubusercontent.com/GovarJabbar/Quran-PNG` works on iOS via `<Image>` + `<FlatList>`.
- URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GovarJabbar/Quran-PNG/master/{NNN}.png` (NNN zero-padded 001–604).
- Page aspect ratio ~1.45:1.
- For RTL navigation use FlatList with `inverted` prop.

### Metro + pnpm requires explicit config (2026-04-27)
- When adding native dependencies, Metro with pnpm-style symlinks fails to resolve packages by default.
- Fix: `artifacts/noor-mobile/metro.config.js` must set `config.watchFolders = [workspaceRoot]` and `config.resolver.nodeModulesPaths = [projectRoot/node_modules, workspaceRoot/node_modules]`.
- DO NOT set `disableHierarchicalLookup: true` — pnpm's deeply nested `.pnpm/` requires hierarchical lookup ON.
- After modifying `metro.config.js`, restart with `npx expo start --clear`.

### Memorization screen architecture (2026-04-27, Phase 2D + Slice 5a)
- One file: `app/child/[childId]/memorization.tsx`. ~1500 lines after Slice 5a Session 2.
- Audio state lives in refs because `expo-av` status callback closes over stale state. Pattern: `const fooRef = useRef(foo); useEffect(() => { fooRef.current = foo; }, [foo]);`
- Audio refs as of Slice 5a Session 2: `viewModeRef`, `currentVerseRef`, `ayahEndRef`, `isPlayingRef`, `isLoadingRef`, `pendingSeekPositionRef`, `repeatCountRef`, `autoAdvanceDelayRef`, `autoplayThroughRangeRef`, `reciteModeRef`, `reciteExpectedIdxRef`, `displayWordsMapRef`, `surahNumberRef`, `matchedWordCountRef`, `lastMatchedWordRef`, `lastMatchTimeRef`, `reciterRef`, `saveTimerRef`, `playbackRateRef`. Plus timer/raf/sound refs.
- Two render modes (`viewMode: "ayah" | "page"`). Two highlight states (`highlightedWord` for ayah, `highlightedPage: { verseKey, position }` for page).
- QDC segments are 1-indexed and skip non-word tokens (filter `char_type_name === "word"` first).
- Husary `qdcId: 6`, `quranComId: null`. Don't assume null `quranComId` means no timing data.
- iOS audio session conflict: `expo-av` and `expo-speech-recognition` can't both hold the session. `pauseAsync()` not enough — must `unloadAsync()`. `stopAudioCompletely()` is the single cleanup point.

### Reciter audio infrastructure (2026-04-27, Slice 5a Session 1)
- 7 reciters in `src/lib/reciters.ts`: husary, afasy, sudais, basit, minshawi, ghamdi, ajmi.
- everyayah folder names verified against the canonical `everyayah.com/recitations_pages.html` list. Three names in the original web table were stale: Sudais (`Sudais_192kbps` → `Abdurrahmaan_As-Sudais_192kbps`), Minshawi (`Minshawi_Murattal_128kbps` → `Minshawy_Murattal_128kbps` with y), Ajmi (`ahmed_ibn_ali_al-ajmy128kbps` → `Ahmed_ibn_Ali_al-Ajamy_128kbps_ketaballah.net`).
- Quran.com v4 `by_ayah` endpoint returns `segments: undefined` for all 6 non-Husary reciter IDs (verified via diagnostic logging Apr 27). Web app uses same endpoint and gets same empty result — falls back to fractional approximation.
- Fractional fallback in `tick()`: `Math.floor(shiftedFrac * wordCount)` where `shiftedFrac = (pos + LEAD_MS) / dur, clamped to 1`. `LEAD_MS = 500` after tuning. Provides anticipatory feel similar to Husary's QDC segment 1 starting at frac=0.
- iOS audio session: `Audio.setAudioModeAsync({ playsInSilentModeIOS: true })` mandatory — without it the silent switch silences playback through the speaker. AirPods always work because Bluetooth bypasses the switch.
- everyayah recordings have wildly different mastered volumes. Afasy_128kbps is significantly quieter than Husary_128kbps. Compensate with `setVolumeAsync(1.0)` on every Sound after `createAsync`.
- `setRateAsync(rate, /* shouldCorrectPitch */ true)` works on `expo-av` Sound. Range 0.75–1.5 is comfortable. `shouldCorrectPitch=true` keeps recitation pitch natural.

### Profile vs session settings (2026-04-27, Slice 5a Session 1)
- `src/lib/settings.ts` exports `loadProfileSettings`/`saveProfileSettings` (themeKey, reciterId, viewMode — persisted to AsyncStorage) and `DEFAULT_SESSION_SETTINGS` constants (repeatCount, autoAdvanceDelayMs, autoplayThroughRange, blurMode, blindMode — reset each session).
- Profile-level edited via future Profile Settings page (Phase 2E). For now, defaults hardcoded.
- Session 2 added `playbackRate` and `tajweedEnabled` as plain inline `useState` defaults (not added to `DEFAULT_SESSION_SETTINGS`); they reset on screen mount.
- Persistence currently buggy — profile settings don't survive app close. Likely hydrate-effect ordering. Low priority per user.

### Tajweed (2026-04-27, Slice 5a Session 2 — partial)
- `src/lib/tajweed.ts` has the 21-class `TAJWEED_COLORS` map (ported from `noor-path/src/components/mushaf/bayaan/bayaan-constants.ts` `TAJWEED_CSS`) plus `extractTajweedColor(html)` which extracts the first `class="..."` and looks up the hex.
- Mobile assumed Quran.com v4 supports `text_uthmani_tajweed` as a `word_field`. On hardware no colors render. Likely the field isn't populated at the word level — only at verse level (web app fetches `text_uthmani_tajweed` on the verse and uses `splitTajweedIntoWords` from `bayaan-utils.ts` to chunk it). Fix path documented in backlog.

### Translation popup (2026-04-27, Slice 5a Session 2)
- Quran.com v4 `word_fields=translation` + `translations=131` (Sahih International) populates a `translation` field on each word. May come back as a `{ text, language_name }` object OR a plain string — handle both.
- `onLongPress` with `delayLongPress={400}` is a comfortable threshold (short tap still fires `onPress`).
- RN backdrop-dismiss pattern: outer `Pressable` is the backdrop with `onPress={close}`; inner card is also a `Pressable` with `onPress={() => {}}` (empty) to absorb taps so they don't bubble to the backdrop. Plain `<View>` for the card would let taps fall through.

### Arabic fuzzy matching for on-device speech recognition (2026-04-27, Slice 4 hotfixes)
- iOS speech recognition returns plain Arabic — no hamza variants (أإآاٱ all collapse to ا), no ta-marbuta (ة → ه), no ya-with-hamza (ئ → ي), often without "ال" prefix.
- The web app's `stripTashkeel` does the full normalization.
- Multi-predicate match: equality, substring either direction, subsequence either direction, noun-vowel-stripped equality, word-final ت→ه swap. `ال` prefix stripping with ≥2-char fallback. 1-char heard tokens reject unless equal.
- iOS sends growing partial transcripts each event. Matcher walks full transcript from `matchedWordCountRef` forward.
- iOS recognition has 60s session limit + warm-up gibberish at restart. Multi-predicate matchers reject the gibberish naturally.

### EAS dev build (2026-04-27)
- Expo Go does not include native modules. Use `eas build --profile development --platform ios`.
- Use `npx eas-cli@latest <cmd>` (avoid global-install permission issues).
- iOS 16+ requires Developer Mode (Settings → Privacy & Security → Developer Mode → enable → restart).
- Trust developer profile in iPhone Settings → General → VPN & Device Management.
- Run dev server: `npx expo start --dev-client` (the `--dev-client` flag is critical).
- Re-run `eas build` only when adding new native deps or changing `app.json` plugin entries. Pure JS hot-reloads.
